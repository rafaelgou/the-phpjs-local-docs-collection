    Replication enables data from one MySQL database server (the master)
    to be replicated to one or more MySQL database servers (the slaves).
    Replication is asynchronous by default - slaves need not to
    connected permanently to receive updates from the master. This means
    that updates can occur over long-distance connections and even over
    temporary or intermittent connections such as a dial-up service.
    Depending on the configuration, you can replicate all databases,
    selected databases, or even selected tables within a database.
  </p><p>
    For answers to some questions often asked by those who are new to
    MySQL Replication, see <a class="xref" href="faqs.html#faqs-replication" title="B.13. MySQL 5.6 FAQ: Replication">Section B.13, “MySQL 5.6 FAQ: Replication”</a>.
  </p><p>
    The target uses for replication in MySQL include:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        Scale-out solutions - spreading the load among multiple slaves
        to improve performance. In this environment, all writes and
        updates must take place on the master server. Reads, however,
        may take place on one or more slaves. This model can improve the
        performance of writes (since the master is dedicated to
        updates), while dramatically increasing read speed across an
        increasing number of slaves.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Data security - because data is replicated to the slave, and the
        slave can pause the replication process, it is possible to run
        backup services on the slave without corrupting the
        corresponding master data.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Analytics - live data can be created on the master, while the
        analysis of the information can take place on the slave without
        affecting the performance of the master.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Long-distance data distribution - if a branch office would like
        to work with a copy of your main data, you can use replication
        to create a local copy of the data for their use without
        requiring permanent access to the master.
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
    Replication in MySQL features support for one-way, asynchronous
    replication, in which one server acts as the master, while one or
    more other servers act as slaves. This is in contrast to the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>synchronous</em></span> replication which is a
    characteristic of MySQL Cluster (see
    <a class="xref" href="mysql-cluster.html" title="Chapter 17. MySQL Cluster NDB 7.3">Chapter 17, <i>MySQL Cluster NDB 7.3</i></a>). In MySQL 5.6, an
    interface to semisynchronous replication is supported in addition to
    the built-in asynchronous replication. With semisynchronous
    replication, a commit performed on the master side blocks before
    returning to the session that performed the transaction until at
    least one slave acknowledges that it has received and logged the
    events for the transaction. See
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-semisync" title="16.3.8. Semisynchronous Replication">Section 16.3.8, “Semisynchronous Replication”</a> MySQL 5.6 also
    supports delayed replication such that a slave server deliberately
    lags behind the master by at least a specified amount of time. See
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-delayed" title="16.3.9. Delayed Replication">Section 16.3.9, “Delayed Replication”</a>.
  </p><p>
    There are a number of solutions available for setting up replication
    between two servers, but the best method to use depends on the
    presence of data and the engine types you are using. For more
    information on the available options, see
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto" title="16.1.1. How to Set Up Replication">Section 16.1.1, “How to Set Up Replication”</a>.
  </p><p>
    There are two core types of replication format, Statement Based
    Replication (SBR), which replicates entire SQL statements, and Row
    Based Replication (RBR), which replicates only the changed rows. You
    may also use a third variety, Mixed Based Replication (MBR). For
    more information on the different replication formats, see
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-formats" title="16.1.2. Replication Formats">Section 16.1.2, “Replication Formats”</a>. In MySQL 5.6,
    statement-based format is the default.
  </p><p>
    MySQL 5.6.5 and later supports transactional replication based on
    <em class="firstterm">global transaction identifiers</em> (GTIDs). When
    using this type of replication, it is not necessary to work directly
    with log files or positions within these files, which greatly
    simplifies many common replication tasks. Because replication using
    GTIDs is entirely transactional, consistency between master and
    slave is guaranteed as long as all transactions committed on the
    master have also been applied on the slave. For more information
    about GTIDs and GTID-based replication, see
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-gtids" title="16.1.3. Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers">Section 16.1.3, “Replication with Global Transaction Identifiers”</a>.
  </p><p>
    Replication is controlled through a number of different options and
    variables. These control the core operation of the replication,
    timeouts, and the databases and filters that can be applied on
    databases and tables. For more information on the available options,
    see <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-options" title="16.1.4. Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables">Section 16.1.4, “Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables”</a>.
  </p><p>
    You can use replication to solve a number of different problems,
    including problems with performance, supporting the backup of
    different databases, and as part of a larger solution to alleviate
    system failures. For information on how to address these issues, see
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-solutions" title="16.3. Replication Solutions">Section 16.3, “Replication Solutions”</a>.
  </p><p>
    For notes and tips on how different data types and statements are
    treated during replication, including details of replication
    features, version compatibility, upgrades, and problems and their
    resolution, including an FAQ, see

<p>
    Replication between servers in MySQL is based on the binary logging
    mechanism. The MySQL instance operating as the master (the source of
    the database changes) writes updates and changes as
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">events</span>”</span> to the binary log. The information in the
    binary log is stored in different logging formats according to the
    database changes being recorded. Slaves are configured to read the
    binary log from the master and to execute the events in the binary
    log on the slave's local database.
  </p><p>
    The master is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">dumb</span>”</span> in this scenario. Once binary
    logging has been enabled, all statements are recorded in the binary
    log. Each slave receives a copy of the entire contents of the binary
    log. It is the responsibility of the slave to decide which
    statements in the binary log should be executed; you cannot
    configure the master to log only certain events. If you do not
    specify otherwise, all events in the master binary log are executed
    on the slave. If required, you can configure the slave to process
    only events that apply to particular databases or tables.
  </p><p>
    Each slave keeps a record of the binary log coordinates: The file
    name and position within the file that it has read and processed
    from the master. This means that multiple slaves can be connected to
    the master and executing different parts of the same binary log.
    Because the slaves control this process, individual slaves can be
    connected and disconnected from the server without affecting the
    master's operation. Also, because each slave remembers the position
    within the binary log, it is possible for slaves to be disconnected,
    reconnect and then <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">catch up</span>”</span> by continuing from the
    recorded position.
  </p><p>
    Both the master and each slave must be configured with a unique ID
    (using the <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_server-id"><code class="option">server-id</code></a> option). In
    addition, each slave must be configured with information about the
    master host name, log file name, and position within that file.
    These details can be controlled from within a MySQL session using
    the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#change-master-to" title="13.4.2.1. CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"><code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER TO</code></a> statement on the
    slave. The details are stored within the slave's master info
    repository, which can be either a file or a table (see
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#slave-logs" title="16.2.2. Replication Relay and Status Logs">Section 16.2.2, “Replication Relay and Status Logs”</a>).

    replication environment, including step-by-step instructions for
    creating a new replication environment. The major components of this

        Events in the binary log are recorded using a number of formats.
        These are referred to as statement-based replication (SBR) or
        row-based replication (RBR). A third type, mixed-format
        replication (MIXED), uses SBR or RBR replication automatically
        to take advantage of the benefits of both SBR and RBR formats
        when appropriate. The different formats are discussed in

<p>
      This section describes how to set up complete replication of a
      MySQL server. There are a number of different methods for setting
      up replication, and the exact method to use depends on how you are
      setting up replication, and whether you already have data within
      your master database.
    </p><p>
      There are some generic tasks that are common to all replication
      setups:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          On the master, you must enable binary logging and configure a
          unique server ID. This might require a server restart. See
          <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto-masterbaseconfig" title="16.1.1.1. Setting the Replication Master Configuration">Section 16.1.1.1, “Setting the Replication Master Configuration”</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          On each slave that you want to connect to the master, you must
          configure a unique server ID. This might require a server
          restart. See
          <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto-slavebaseconfig" title="16.1.1.2. Setting the Replication Slave Configuration">Section 16.1.1.2, “Setting the Replication Slave Configuration”</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          You may want to create a separate user that will be used by
          your slaves to authenticate with the master to read the binary
          log for replication. The step is optional. See
          <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto-repuser" title="16.1.1.3. Creating a User for Replication">Section 16.1.1.3, “Creating a User for Replication”</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Before creating a data snapshot or starting the replication
          process, you should record the position of the binary log on
          the master. You will need this information when configuring
          the slave so that the slave knows where within the binary log
          to start executing events. See
          <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto-masterstatus" title="16.1.1.4. Obtaining the Replication Master Binary Log Coordinates">Section 16.1.1.4, “Obtaining the Replication Master Binary Log Coordinates”</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If you already have data on your master and you want to use it
          to synchronize your slave, you will need to create a data
          snapshot. You can create a snapshot using
          <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a> (see
          <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto-mysqldump" title="16.1.1.5. Creating a Data Snapshot Using mysqldump">Section 16.1.1.5, “Creating a Data Snapshot Using <span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span>”</a>) or by copying
          the data files directly (see
          <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto-rawdata" title="16.1.1.6. Creating a Data Snapshot Using Raw Data Files">Section 16.1.1.6, “Creating a Data Snapshot Using Raw Data Files”</a>).
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          You will need to configure the slave with settings for
          connecting to the master, such as the host name, login
          credentials, and binary log file name and position. See
          <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto-slaveinit" title="16.1.1.10. Setting the Master Configuration on the Slave">Section 16.1.1.10, “Setting the Master Configuration on the Slave”</a>.
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
      Once you have configured the basic options, you will need to
      follow the instructions for your replication setup. A number of
      alternatives are provided:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          If you are establishing a new MySQL master and one or more
          slaves, you need only set up the configuration, as you have no
          data to exchange. For guidance on setting up replication in
          this situation, see
          <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto-newservers" title="16.1.1.7. Setting Up Replication with New Master and Slaves">Section 16.1.1.7, “Setting Up Replication with New Master and Slaves”</a>.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

<p>
        On a replication master, you must enable binary logging and
        establish a unique server ID. If this has not already been done,
        this part of master setup requires a server restart.
      </p><p>
        Binary logging <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be enabled on the
        master because the binary log is the basis for sending data
        changes from the master to its slaves. If binary logging is not
        enabled, replication will not be possible.
      </p><p>
        Each server within a replication group must be configured with a
        unique server ID. This ID is used to identify individual servers
        within the group, and must be a positive integer between 1 and
        (2<sup>32</sup>)–1. How you organize and
        select the numbers is entirely up to you.
      </p><p>
        To configure the binary log and server ID options, you will need
        to shut down your MySQL server and edit the
        <code class="filename">my.cnf</code> or <code class="filename">my.ini</code> file.
        Add the following options to the configuration file within the
        <code class="literal">[mysqld]</code> section. If these options already
        exist, but are commented out, uncomment the options and alter
        them according to your needs. For example, to enable binary
        logging using a log file name prefix of
        <code class="literal">mysql-bin</code>, and configure a server ID of 1,
        use these lines:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">[mysqld]
log-bin=mysql-bin
server-id=1</pre><p>
        After making the changes, restart the server.

<p>
        On a replication slave, you must establish a unique server ID.
        If this has not already been done, this part of slave setup
        requires a server restart.
      </p><p>
        If the slave server ID is not already set, or the current value
        conflicts with the value that you have chosen for the master
        server, you should shut down your slave server and edit the
        configuration to specify a unique server ID. For example:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">[mysqld]
server-id=2</pre><p>
        After making the changes, restart the server.
      </p><p>
        If you are setting up multiple slaves, each one must have a
        unique <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_server-id"><code class="option">server-id</code></a> value that
        differs from that of the master and from each of the other
        slaves. Think of <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_server-id"><code class="option">server-id</code></a> values
        as something similar to IP addresses: These IDs uniquely
        identify each server instance in the community of replication
        partners.

<p>
        Each slave must connect to the master using a MySQL user name
        and password, so there must be a user account on the master that
        the slave can use to connect. Any account can be used for this
        operation, providing it has been granted the
        <a class="link" href="security.html#priv_replication-slave"><code class="literal">REPLICATION SLAVE</code></a> privilege. You
        may wish to create a different account for each slave, or
        connect to the master using the same account for each slave.
      </p><p>
        You need not create an account specifically for replication.
        However, you should be aware that the user name and password are
        stored in plain text in the master info repository file or table
        (see <a class="xref" href="replication.html#slave-logs-status" title="16.2.2.2. Slave Status Logs">Section 16.2.2.2, “Slave Status Logs”</a>). Therefore, you may

</div>

</div>
<p>
        To configure replication on the slave you must determine the
        master's current coordinates within its binary log. You will
        need this information so that when the slave starts the
        replication process, it is able to start processing events from
        the binary log at the correct point.
      </p><p>
        If you have existing data on your master that you want to
        synchronize on your slaves before starting the replication
        process, you must stop processing statements on the master, and
        then obtain its current binary log coordinates and dump its
        data, before permitting the master to continue executing
        statements. If you do not stop the execution of statements, the
        data dump and the master status information that you use will
        not match and you will end up with inconsistent or corrupted
        databases on the slaves.

        use the <span class="command"><strong>mysqlbackup</strong></span> command from the MySQL
        Enterprise Backup component to produce a consistent snapshot.
        This command records the log name and offset corresponding to
        the snapshot to be later used on the slave. MySQL Enterprise
        Backup is a commercial product that is included as part of a
        MySQL Enterprise subscription. See
        <a class="xref" href="mysql-enterprise.html#mysql-enterprise-backup" title="24.2. MySQL Enterprise Backup">Section 24.2, “MySQL Enterprise Backup”</a> for detailed

        <span class="command"><strong>tar</strong></span>, or a file system snapshot tool such as
        <span class="command"><strong>dump</strong></span>, providing that your MySQL data files
        exist on a single file system. If you are replicating only
        certain databases, copy only those files that relate to those
        tables. (For <code class="literal">InnoDB</code>, all tables in all

</div>

</div>

</div>
<p>
        The easiest and most straightforward method for setting up
        replication is to use new master and slave servers.
      </p><p>
        You can also use this method if you are setting up new servers
        but have an existing dump of the databases from a different
        server that you want to load into your replication
        configuration. By loading the data into a new master, the data
        will be automatically replicated to the slaves.
      </p><p>
        To set up replication between a new master and slave:
</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            Configure the MySQL master with the necessary configuration
            properties. See
            <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto-masterbaseconfig" title="16.1.1.1. Setting the Replication Master Configuration">Section 16.1.1.1, “Setting the Replication Master Configuration”</a>.

            Start up the MySQL master.

          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Obtain the master status information. See

          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Start up the MySQL slave.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Execute a <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#change-master-to" title="13.4.2.1. CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"><code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER TO</code></a>
            statement to set the master replication server
            configuration. See
            <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto-slaveinit" title="16.1.1.10. Setting the Master Configuration on the Slave">Section 16.1.1.10, “Setting the Master Configuration on the Slave”</a>.
</p></li></ol>
</div>
<p>
        Perform the slave setup steps on each slave.
      </p><p>
        Because there is no data to load or exchange on a new server
        configuration you do not need to copy or import any information.
      </p><p>
        If you are setting up a new replication environment using the
        data from a different existing database server, you will now
        need to run the dump file generated from that server on the new
        master. The database updates will automatically be propagated to
        the slaves:

</div>
<p>
        When setting up replication with existing data, you will need to
        decide how best to get the data from the master to the slave
        before starting the replication service.
      </p><p>
        The basic process for setting up replication with existing data
        is as follows:
</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            With the MySQL master running, create a user to be used by
            the slave when connecting to the master during replication.

            logging on the master server, you will need to shut it down
            to configure these options. See

          </p><p>
            If you have to shut down your master server, this is a good
            opportunity to take a snapshot of its databases. You should
            obtain the master status (see

            taking down the master, updating the configuration and
            taking a snapshot. For information on how to create a
            snapshot using raw data files, see

                You may need to set permissions and ownership on the

            Also, configure the slave with the login credentials and
            host name of the master. For more information on the

        After you have performed this procedure, the slave should
        connect to the master and catch up on any updates that have
        occurred since the snapshot was taken.
      </p><p>
        If you have forgotten to set the

        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_server-id"><code class="option">server-id</code></a> option for the slave,
        you get the following error in the slave's error log:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">Warning: You should set server-id to a non-0 value if master_host

        You also find error messages in the slave's error log if it is
        not able to replicate for any other reason.
      </p><p>
        The slave uses information stored in its master info repository
        to keep track of how much of the master's binary log it has
        processed. The repository can be in the form of files or a

        <code class="filename">relay-log.info</code>. If
        <code class="option">--master-info-repository=TABLE</code> instead, this

</div>
<p>
        To add another slave to an existing replication configuration,
        you can do so without stopping the master. Instead, set up the
        new slave by making a copy of an existing slave, except that you
        configure the new slave with a different
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_server-id"><code class="option">server-id</code></a> value.
      </p><p>
        To duplicate an existing slave:
</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            Shut down the existing slave:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>mysqladmin shutdown</code></strong>
</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Copy the data directory from the existing slave to the new
            slave. You can do this by creating an archive using
            <span class="command"><strong>tar</strong></span> or <code class="literal">WinZip</code>, or by
            performing a direct copy using a tool such as
            <span class="command"><strong>cp</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>rsync</strong></span>. Ensure
            that you also copy the log files and relay log files.
          </p><p>
            A common problem that is encountered when adding new
            replication slaves is that the new slave fails with a series
            of warning and error messages like these:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">071118 16:44:10 [Warning] Neither --relay-log nor --relay-log-index were used; so

            This is due to the fact that, if the
            <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log"><code class="option">--relay-log</code></a> option is not
            specified, the relay log files contain the host name as part
            of their file names. (This is also true of the relay log
            index file if the
            <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-index"><code class="option">--relay-log-index</code></a> option is

            <code class="literal"><em class="replaceable"><code>existing_slave_hostname</code></em>-relay-bin</code>.)
            If this is not feasible, copy the existing slave's relay log
            index file to the new slave and set the
            <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-index"><code class="option">--relay-log-index</code></a> option on

      Replication works because events written to the binary log are
      read from the master and then processed on the slave. The events
      are recorded within the binary log in different formats according
      to the type of event. The different replication formats used
      correspond to the binary logging format used when the events were
      recorded in the master's binary log. The correlation between
      binary logging formats and the terms used during replication are:

<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          Replication capabilities in MySQL originally were based on
          propagation of SQL statements from master to slave. This is
          called <em class="firstterm">statement-based replication</em>
          (often abbreviated as <em class="firstterm">SBR</em>), which
          corresponds to the standard statement-based binary logging
          format. In older versions of MySQL (5.1.4 and earlier), binary
          logging and replication used this format exclusively.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Row-based binary logging logs changes in individual table
          rows. When used with MySQL replication, this is known as
          <em class="firstterm">row-based replication</em> (often
          abbreviated as <em class="firstterm">RBR</em>). In row-based
          replication, the master writes <em class="firstterm">events</em>
          to the binary log that indicate how individual table rows are
          changed.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The server can change the binary logging format in real time
          according to the type of event using <em class="firstterm">mixed-format
          logging</em>.
        </p><p>
          When the mixed format is in effect, statement-based logging is
          used by default, but automatically switches to row-based
          logging in particular cases as described later. Replication
          using the mixed format is often referred to as
          <em class="firstterm">mixed-based replication</em> or
          <em class="firstterm">mixed-format replication</em>. For more
          information, see <a class="xref" href="server-administration.html#binary-log-mixed" title="5.2.4.3. Mixed Binary Logging Format">Section 5.2.4.3, “Mixed Binary Logging Format”</a>.
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
      In MySQL 5.6, statement-based format is the default.
    </p><p><b>MySQL Cluster. </b>
        The default binary logging format in all MySQL Cluster NDB 7.3
        releases is <code class="literal">MIXED</code>. You should note that MySQL
        Cluster Replication always uses row-based replication, and that
        the <a class="link" href="mysql-cluster.html" title="Chapter 17. MySQL Cluster NDB 7.3"><code class="literal">NDB</code></a> storage engine is
        incompatible with statement-based replication. See
        <a class="xref" href="mysql-cluster.html#mysql-cluster-replication-general" title="17.6.2. General Requirements for MySQL Cluster Replication">Section 17.6.2, “General Requirements for MySQL Cluster Replication”</a>, for more
        information.
      </p><p>
      When using <code class="literal">MIXED</code> format, the binary logging
      format is determined in part by the storage engine being used and
      the statement being executed. For more information on mixed-format
      logging and the rules governing the support of different logging
      formats, see <a class="xref" href="server-administration.html#binary-log-mixed" title="5.2.4.3. Mixed Binary Logging Format">Section 5.2.4.3, “Mixed Binary Logging Format”</a>.
    </p><p>
      The logging format in a running MySQL server is controlled by
      setting the <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format</code></a> server
      system variable. This variable can be set with session or global
      scope. The rules governing when and how the new setting takes
      effect are the same as for other MySQL server system
      variables—setting the variable for the current session lasts
      only until the end of that session, and the change is not visible
      to other sessions; setting the variable globally requires a
      restart of the server to take effect. For more information, see
      <a class="xref" href="sql-syntax.html#set-statement" title="13.7.4. SET Syntax">Section 13.7.4, “<code class="literal">SET</code> Syntax”</a>.
    </p><p>
      There are conditions under which you cannot change the binary
      logging format at runtime or doing so causes replication to fail.
      See <a class="xref" href="server-administration.html#binary-log-setting" title="5.2.4.2. Setting The Binary Log Format">Section 5.2.4.2, “Setting The Binary Log Format”</a>.
    </p><p>
      You must have the <a class="link" href="security.html#priv_super"><code class="literal">SUPER</code></a> privilege
      to set either the global or session
      <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format</code></a> value.
    </p><p>
      The statement-based and row-based replication formats have
      different issues and limitations. For a comparison of their
      relative advantages and disadvantages, see
      <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-sbr-rbr" title="16.1.2.1. Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based Replication">Section 16.1.2.1, “Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based
        Replication”</a>.
    </p><p>
      With statement-based replication, you may encounter issues with
      replicating stored routines or triggers. You can avoid these
      issues by using row-based replication instead. For more
      information, see <a class="xref" href="stored-programs-views.html#stored-programs-logging" title="19.7. Binary Logging of Stored Programs">Section 19.7, “Binary Logging of Stored Programs”</a>.

        Each binary logging format has advantages and disadvantages. For
        most users, the mixed replication format should provide the best
        combination of data integrity and performance. If, however, you
        want to take advantage of the features specific to the
        statement-based or row-based replication format when performing
        certain tasks, you can use the information in this section,

        disadvantages, to determine which is best for your needs.

<p>
        Major changes in the replication environment and in the behavior
        of applications can result from using row-based logging (RBL) or
        row-based replication (RBR) rather than statement-based logging
        or replication. This section describes a number of issues known
        to exist when using row-based logging or replication, and
        discusses some best practices for taking advantage of row-based
        logging and replication.

              temporary tables are not replicated when using row-based
              format. When mixed format is in effect,
              <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">safe</span>”</span> statements involving temporary tables
              are logged using statement-based format. For more
              information, see <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-sbr-rbr" title="16.1.2.1. Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based Replication">Section 16.1.2.1, “Advantages and Disadvantages of Statement-Based and Row-Based
        Replication”</a>.
            </p><p>
            Temporary tables are not replicated when using row-based
            format because there is no need. In addition, because
            temporary tables can be read only from the thread which
            created them, there is seldom if ever any benefit obtained
            from replicating them, even when using statement-based
            format.
          </p><p>
            In MySQL 5.6, you can switch from
            statement-based to row-based binary logging mode even when
            temporary tables have been created. However, while using the
            row-based format, the MySQL server cannot determine the
            logging mode that was in effect when a given temporary table
            was created. For this reason, the server in such cases logs
            a <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#drop-table" title="13.1.28. DROP TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">DROP TEMPORARY
            TABLE IF EXISTS</code></a> statement for each temporary table
            that still exists for a given client session when that
            session ends. While this means that it is possible that an
            unnecessary <code class="literal">DROP TEMPORARY TABLE</code>
            statement might be logged in some cases, the statement is
            harmless, and does not cause an error even if the table does
            not exist, due to the presence of the <code class="literal">IF NOT
            EXISTS</code> option.
          </p><p>
            In MySQL 5.6.6 and earlier, the
            <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_disable-gtid-unsafe-statements"><code class="option">--disable-gtid-unsafe-statements</code></a>
            option caused any nontransactional DML statement involving
            temporary tables to fail with an error when using row-based
            logging, in spite of the fact that they are not written to
            the binary log. In MySQL 5.6.7 and later, such statements
            are allowed when using
            <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=ROW</code></a>, as long
            as any nontransactional tables affected by the statements
            are temporary tables (Bug #14272672).
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><b>RBL and synchronization of nontransactional tables. </b>
              When many rows are affected, the set of changes is split
              into several events; when the statement commits, all of
              these events are written to the binary log. When executing
              on the slave, a table lock is taken on all tables
              involved, and then the rows are applied in batch mode.
              (This may or may not be effective, depending on the engine
              used for the slave's copy of the table.)
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><b>Latency and binary log size. </b>
              Because RBL writes changes for each row to the binary log,
              its size can increase quite rapidly. In a replication
              environment, this can significantly increase the time
              required to make changes on the slave that match those on
              the master. You should be aware of the potential for this
              delay in your applications.

        When speaking of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">safeness</span>”</span> of a statement in
        MySQL Replication, we are referring to whether a statement and
        its effects can be replicated correctly using statement-based
        format. If this is true of the statement, we refer to the
        statement as <em class="firstterm">safe</em>; otherwise, we refer to
        it as <em class="firstterm">unsafe</em>.
      </p><p>
        In general, a statement is safe if it deterministic, and unsafe
        if it is not. However, certain nondeterministic functions are
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> considered unsafe (see
        <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-rbr-safe-unsafe-not" title="Nondeterministic functions not considered unsafe">Nondeterministic functions not considered unsafe</a>, later in this
        section). In addition, statements using results from
        floating-point math functions—which are
        hardware-dependent—are always considered safe (see
        <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-features-floatvalues" title="16.4.1.12. Replication and Floating-Point Values">Section 16.4.1.12, “Replication and Floating-Point Values”</a>).
      </p><p><b>Handling of safe and unsafe statements. </b>
          A statement is treated differently depending on whether the
          statement is considered safe, and with respect to the binary
          logging format (that is, the current value of
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format</code></a>).

          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If the binary logging format is <code class="literal">MIXED</code>,
            statements flagged as unsafe are logged using the row-based

            statement-based format.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If the binary logging format is
            <code class="literal">STATEMENT</code>, statements flagged as being

            are logged normally.)
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
        Each statement flagged as unsafe generates a warning. Formerly,
        in cases where a great many such statements were executed on the
        master, this could lead to very large error log files, sometimes
        even filling up an entire disk unexpectedly. To guard against
        this, MySQL 5.6.7 introduced a warning suppression mechanism,
        which behaves as follows: Whenever the 50 most recent
        <a class="link" href="error-handling.html#error_er_binlog_unsafe_statement"><code class="literal">ER_BINLOG_UNSAFE_STATEMENT</code></a>
        warnings have been generated more than 50 times in any 50-second
        period, warning suppression is enabled. When activated, this
        causes such warnings not to be written to the error log;
        instead, for each 50 warnings of this type, a note <code class="literal">The
        last warning was repeated <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> times in
        last <em class="replaceable"><code>S</code></em> seconds</code> is written
        to the error log. This continues as long as the 50 most recent
        such warnings were issued in 50 seconds or less; once the rate
        has decreased below this threshold, the warnings are once again
        logged normally. Warning suppression has no effect on how the
        safety of statements for statement-based logging is determined,
        nor on how warnings are sent to the client (MySQL clients still
        receive one warning for each such statement).

<p>
      In this section, we discuss transaction-based replication using
      <em class="firstterm">global transaction identifiers</em> (GTIDs),
      introduced in MySQL 5.6.5. When using GTIDs, each transaction can
      be identified and tracked as it is committed on the originating
      server and applied by any slaves; this means that it is not
      necessary when using GTIDs to refer to log files or positions
      within those files when starting a new slave or failing over to a
      new master, which greatly simplifies these tasks. Because
      GTID-based replication is completely transaction-based, it is
      simple to determine whether masters and slaves are consistent; as
      long as all transactions committed on a master are also committed
      on a slave, consistency between the two is guaranteed. You can use
      either statement-based or row-based replication with GTIDs (see
      <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-formats" title="16.1.2. Replication Formats">Section 16.1.2, “Replication Formats”</a>); however, for best results,
      we recommend that you use the row-based format.

<p>
        A global transaction identifier (GTID) is a unique identifier
        created and associated with each transaction when it is
        committed on the server of origin (master). This identifier is
        unique not only to the server on which it originated, but is
        unique across all servers in a given replication setup. There is
        a 1-to-1 mapping between all transactions and all GTIDs.
      </p><p>
        A GTID is represented as a pair of coordinates, separated by a
        colon character (<code class="literal">:</code>), as shown here:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">GTID = <em class="replaceable"><code>source_id</code></em>:<em class="replaceable"><code>transaction_id</code></em>
</pre><p>
        The <em class="replaceable"><code>source_id</code></em> identifies the
        originating server. Normally, the server's
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_server_uuid"><code class="literal">server_uuid</code></a> is used for this
        purpose. (It is theoretically possible for it to be determined
        in a different manner if the source of the transaction is not a
        MySQL Server instance, but this is currently not supported.) The
        <em class="replaceable"><code>transaction_id</code></em> is a sequence number
        determined by the order in which the transaction was committed
        on this server; for example, the first transaction to be
        committed has <code class="literal">1</code> as its
        <em class="replaceable"><code>transaction_id</code></em>, and the tenth
        transaction to be committed on the same originating server is
        assigned a <em class="replaceable"><code>transaction_id</code></em> of
        <code class="literal">10</code>. (It is not possible for a transaction to
        have <code class="literal">0</code> as a sequence number in a GTID.) Thus,
        the twenty-third transaction to be committed originally on the
        server having the UUID
        <code class="literal">3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562</code> has this
        GTID:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:23</pre><p>
        This format is used to represent GTIDs in the output of
        statements such as <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#show-slave-status" title="13.7.5.35. SHOW SLAVE STATUS Syntax"><code class="literal">SHOW SLAVE
        STATUS</code></a> as well as in the binary log. They can also be
        seen when viewing the log file with
        <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqlbinlog" title="4.6.8. mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"><span class="command"><strong>mysqlbinlog</strong></span></a>
        <a class="link" href="programs.html#option_mysqlbinlog_base64-output"><code class="option">--base64-output=DECODE-ROWS</code></a>
        or in the output from <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#show-binlog-events" title="13.7.5.3. SHOW BINLOG EVENTS Syntax"><code class="literal">SHOW BINLOG
        EVENTS</code></a>.
      </p><p>
        As written in the output of statements such as
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#show-master-status" title="13.7.5.24. SHOW MASTER STATUS Syntax"><code class="literal">SHOW MASTER STATUS</code></a>, <code class="literal">SHOW
        SLAVE STATUS</code>, a sequence of GTIDs originating from the
        same server may be collapsed into a single expression, as shown
        here.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562:1-5</pre><p>
        The example just shown represents the first through fifth
        transactions originating on the MySQL Server whose
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_server_uuid"><code class="literal">server_uuid</code></a> is
        <code class="literal">3E11FA47-71CA-11E1-9E33-C80AA9429562</code>.
      </p><p>
        In MySQL 5.6.6 and later, this format is also used to supply the
        argument required by the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#start-slave" title="13.4.2.5. START SLAVE Syntax"><code class="literal">START
        SLAVE</code></a> options <code class="literal">SQL_BEFORE_GTIDS</code> and
        <code class="literal">SQL_AFTER_GTIDS</code>.
      </p><p><a name="replication-gtids-concepts-gtid-sets"></a><b>GTID sets. </b>
          A GTID set is a set of global transaction identifiers which is
          represented as shown here:
        </p><pre class="programlisting"><em class="replaceable"><code>gtid_set</code></em>:
    <em class="replaceable"><code>uuid_set</code></em> [, <em class="replaceable"><code>uuid_set</code></em>] ...
    | ''

<em class="replaceable"><code>uuid_set</code></em>:
    <em class="replaceable"><code>uuid</code></em>:<em class="replaceable"><code>interval</code></em>[:<em class="replaceable"><code>interval</code></em>]...

<em class="replaceable"><code>uuid</code></em>:
    <em class="replaceable"><code>hhhhhhhh</code></em>-<em class="replaceable"><code>hhhh</code></em>-<em class="replaceable"><code>hhhh</code></em>-<em class="replaceable"><code>hhhh</code></em>-<em class="replaceable"><code>hhhhhhhhhhhh</code></em>

<em class="replaceable"><code>h</code></em>:
    [0-9,A-F]

<em class="replaceable"><code>interval</code></em>:
    <em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>[-<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>]

    (<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> &gt;= 1) 
</pre><p>
        GTID sets are used in the MySQL Server in several ways. For
        example, the values stored by the
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> and
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_gtid_purged"><code class="literal">gtid_purged</code></a> system variables
        are represented as GTID sets. In addition, the functions
        <a class="link" href="functions.html#function_gtid-subset"><code class="literal">GTID_SUBSET()</code></a> and
        <a class="link" href="functions.html#function_gtid-subtract"><code class="literal">GTID_SUBTRACT()</code></a> require GTID sets
        as input.
      </p><p>
        GTIDs are always preserved between master and slave. This means
        that you can always determine the source for any transaction
        applied on any slave by examining its binary log. In addition,
        once a transaction with a given GTID is committed on a given
        server, any subsequent transaction having the same GTID is
        ignored by that server. Thus, a transaction committed on the
        master can be applied no more than once on the slave, which
        helps to guarantee consistency.
      </p><p>
        When GTIDs are in use, the slave has no need for any nonlocal
        data, such as the name of a file on the master and a position
        within that file. All necessary information for synchronizing
        with the master is obtained directly from the replication data
        stream. From the perspective of the database administrator or
        developer, GTIDs entirely take the place of the file-offset
        pairs previously required to determine points for starting,
        stopping, or resuming the flow of data between master and slave.
        This means that, when you are using GTIDs for replication, you
        do not need (or want) to include
        <code class="literal">MASTER_LOG_FILE</code> or
        <code class="literal">MASTER_LOG_POS</code> options in the
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#change-master-to" title="13.4.2.1. CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"><code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER TO</code></a> statement used
        to direct a slave to replicate from a given master; in place of
        these options, it necessary only to enable the
        <code class="literal">MASTER_AUTO_POSITION</code> option introduced in
        MySQL 5.6.5. For the exact steps needed to configure and start
        masters and slaves using GTID-based replication, see
        <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-gtids-howto" title="16.1.3.2. Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs">Section 16.1.3.2, “Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs”</a>.
      </p><p>
        The generation and lifecycle of a GTID consists of the following
        steps:
</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            A transaction is executed and committed on the master.
          </p><p>
            This transaction is assigned a GTID using the master's
            UUID and the smallest nonzero transaction sequence number
            not yet used on this server; the GTID is written to the
            master's binary log (immediately preceding the
            transaction itself in the log).
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            After the binary log data is transmitted to the slave and
            stored in the slave's relay log (using established
            mechanisms for this process—see
            <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-implementation" title="16.2. Replication Implementation">Section 16.2, “Replication Implementation”</a>, for details),
            the slave reads the GTID and sets the value of its
            <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_gtid_next"><code class="literal">gtid_next</code></a> system variable
            as this GTID. This tells the slave that the next transaction
            must be logged using this GTID.
          </p><p>
            It is important to note that the slave sets
            <code class="literal">gtid_next</code> in a session context.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The slave checks to make sure that this GTID has not already
            been used to log a transaction in its own binary log. If and
            only if this GTID has not been used, the slave then writes
            the GTID and applies the transaction (and writes the
            transaction to its binary log). By reading and checking the
            transaction's GTID first, before processing the
            transaction itself, the slave guarantees not only that no
            previous transaction having this GTID has been applied on
            the slave, but also that no other session has already read
            this GTID but has not yet committed the associated
            transaction. In other words, multiple clients are not
            permitted to apply the same transaction concurrently.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Because <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_gtid_next"><code class="literal">gtid_next</code></a> is not
            empty, the slave does not attempt to generate a GTID for
            this transaction but instead writes the GTID stored in this
            variable—that is, the GTID obtained from the
            master—immediately preceding the transaction in its
            binary log.

<p>
        This section describes a process for configuring and starting
        GTID-based replication in MySQL 5.6. This is a
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cold start</span>”</span> procedure that assumes either that you
        are starting the replication master for the first time, or that
        it is possible to stop it; for information about provisioning
        replication slaves using GTIDs from a running master, see
        <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-gtids-failover" title="16.1.3.3. Using GTIDs for Failover and Scaleout">Section 16.1.3.3, “Using GTIDs for Failover and Scaleout”</a>.
      </p><p>
        The key steps in this startup process for the simplest possible
        GTID replication topology—consisting of one master and one
        slave—are as follows:
</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            If replication is already running, synchronize both servers
            by making them read-only.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Stop both servers.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Restart both servers with GTIDs, binary logging, and slave
            update logging enabled, and with statements that are unsafe
            for GTID-based replication disabled. In addition, the
            servers should be started in read-only mode, and the slave
            SQL and I/O threads should be prevented from starting on the
            slave.
          </p><p>
            The <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqld" title="4.3.1. mysqld — The MySQL Server"><span class="command"><strong>mysqld</strong></span></a> options necessary to start the

          </p><p>
            The SQL statements needed to accomplish this step are
            described in the example that follows later in this section.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Disable read-only mode on both servers, so that they can

</p></li></ol>
</div>
<p>
        We now present a more detailed example. We assume two servers
        already running as master and slave, using MySQL's
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">classic</span>”</span> file-based replication protocol.
      </p><p>
        Most of the steps that follow require the use of the MySQL
        <code class="literal">root</code> account or another MySQL user account
        that has the <a class="link" href="security.html#priv_super"><code class="literal">SUPER</code></a> privilege.
        <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqladmin" title="4.5.2. mysqladmin — Client for Administering a MySQL Server"><span class="command"><strong>mysqladmin</strong></span></a> <code class="literal">shutdown</code>
        requires either the <code class="literal">SUPER</code> privilege or the
        <a class="link" href="security.html#priv_shutdown"><code class="literal">SHUTDOWN</code></a> privilege.
      </p><p><b>Step 1: Synchronize the servers. </b>
          Make the servers read-only. To do this, enable the
          <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_read_only"><code class="literal">read_only</code></a> system variable by
          executing the following statement on both servers:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SET @@global.read_only = ON;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        Then, allow the slave to catch up with the master. <span class="emphasis"><em>It
        is extremely important that you make sure the slave has
        processed all updates before continuing</em></span>.
      </p><p><b>Step 2: Stop both servers. </b>
          Stop each server using <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqladmin" title="4.5.2. mysqladmin — Client for Administering a MySQL Server"><span class="command"><strong>mysqladmin</strong></span></a> as shown
          here, where <em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em> and
          <em class="replaceable"><code>password</code></em> are the user name and
          password for a MySQL user having sufficient privileges to shut
          down the server:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>mysqladmin -u<em class="replaceable"><code>username</code></em> -p<em class="replaceable"><code>password</code></em> shutdown</code></strong>
</pre><p><b>Step 3: Restart both servers with GTIDs enabled. </b>
          To enable binary logging with global transaction identifiers,
          each server must be started with GTID mode, binary logging,
          slave update logging enabled, and with statements that are
          unsafe for GTID-based replication disabled. In addition, you
          should prevent unwanted or accidental updates from being
          performed on either server by starting both in read-only mode
          as well. This means that both servers must be started with (at
          least) the options shown in the following invocation of
          <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqld-safe" title="4.3.2. mysqld_safe — MySQL Server Startup Script"><span class="command"><strong>mysqld_safe</strong></span></a>:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>mysqld_safe --gtid_mode=ON --log-bin --log-slave-updates --enforce-gtid-consistency &amp;</code></strong>

          Instruct the slave to use the master as the replication data
          source, and to use GTID-based auto-positioning rather than
          file-based positioning. You can do this by executing a
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#change-master-to" title="13.4.2.1. CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"><code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER TO</code></a> statement on
          the slave, using the <code class="literal">MASTER_AUTO_POSITION</code>

          by GTIDs.
        </p><p>
        You may also need to supply appropriate values for the
        master's host name and port number as well as the user name
        and password for a replication user account which can be used by
        the slave to connect to the master; if these have already been
        set prior to Step 1 and no further changes need to be made, the
        corresponding options can safely be omitted from the statement
        shown here.

</pre><p>
        Neither the <code class="literal">MASTER_LOG_FILE</code> option nor the
        <code class="literal">MASTER_LOG_POS</code> option may be used with
        <code class="literal">MASTER_AUTO_POSITION</code> set equal to 1.
        Attempting to do so causes the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#change-master-to" title="13.4.2.1. CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"><code class="literal">CHANGE
        MASTER TO</code></a> statement to fail with an error. (If you
        need to revert from GTID-based replication to replication based
        on files and positions, you must use one or both of these
        options together with <code class="literal">MASTER_AUTO_POSITION =
        0</code> in the <code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER TO</code>
        statement.)
      </p><p>
        Assuming that the <code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER TO</code> statement
        has succeeded, you can then start the slave, like this:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>START SLAVE;</code></strong>

        GTID-based replication should now be running, and you can begin

<p>
        There are a number of techniques when using MySQL Replication
        with Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs) in MySQL 5.6.9 and
        later for provisioning a new slave which can then be used for
        scaleout, being promoted to master as necessary for failover. In
        this section, we discuss the four techniques listed here:

</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
        Global transaction identifiers were added to MySQL Replication
        for the purpose of simplifying in general management of the
        replication data flow and of failover activities in particular.
        Each identifier uniquely identifies a set of binary log events
        that together make up a transaction. GTIDs play a key role in
        applying changes to the database: the server automatically skips
        any transaction having an identifier which the server recognizes
        as one that it has processed before. This behavior is critical
        for automatic replication positioning and correct failover.
      </p><p>
        The mapping between identifiers and sets of events comprising a
        given transaction is captured in the binary log. This poses some
        challenges when a user wants to provision a new server with data
        from another existing server. To reproduce the identifier set on
        the new server, it is necessary, not only to copy the
        identifiers from the old server to the new one, but to preserve
        the relationship between the identifiers and the actual events
        as well, which is what is needed for restoring a slave that is
        immediately available as a candidate to become a new master on
        failover or switchover.
      </p><p><a name="replication-gtids-failover-replicate"></a><b>Simple replication. </b>
          This is the easiest way to reproduce all identifiers and
          transactions on a new server; you simply make the new server
          into the slave of a master that has the entire execution
          history, and enable global transaction identifiers on both
          servers. (This requires that both master and slave are running
          with the options <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_gtid-mode"><code class="option">--gtid-mode=ON</code></a>
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-bin"><code class="option">--log-bin</code></a>
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-slave-updates"><code class="option">--log-slave-updates</code></a>
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_enforce-gtid-consistency"><code class="option">--enforce-gtid-consistency</code></a>; see
          <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-gtids-howto" title="16.1.3.2. Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs">Section 16.1.3.2, “Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs”</a>, for more
          information.)
        </p><p>
        Once replication is started, the new server copies the entire
        binary log from the master and thus obtains all information
        about all GTIDs.
      </p><p>
        This method is simple and effective, but requires the slave to
        read the binary log from the master; it can sometimes take a
        comparatively long time for the new slave to catch up with the
        master, so this method is not suitable for fast failover or
        restoring from backup. We can obviate the need to fetch all of
        the execution history from the master by copying binary log
        files to the new server, as discussed in the next few
        paragraphs.
      </p><p><a name="replication-gtids-failover-copy"></a><b>Copying data and transactions to the slave. </b>
          Playing back the entire transaction history can be
          time-consuming, and represents a major bottleneck when setting
          up a new replication slave. To eliminate this requirement, we
          can take from the master a backup that includes, in addition
          to a dump containing a snapshot of the data set, the binary
          logs and the global transaction information they contain.
          Setting up the slave then consists of importing the snapshot,
          then playing back the binary log, after which replication can
          be started, allowing the slave to become current with any
          remaining transactions.
        </p><p>
        There are several variants of this method; these can be
        distinguished by the manner in which data (dumps) and
        transactions (binary logs) are shipped to the new slave, as
        outlined here:

      </p><p>
        This method has the advantage that a new server is available
        almost immediately; only those transactions that were committed
        while the snapshot or dump file was being replayed still need to
        be obtained from the existing master. This means that the
        slave's availability is not instantanteous—but only a
        relatively short amount of time should be required for the slave
        to catch up with these few remaining transactions.
      </p><p>
        Copying over binary logs to the target server in advance is
        usually faster than reading the entire transaction execution
        history from the master in real time. However, due to size or
        other considerations, it may not always be feasible to move
        these files to the target when required. The two remaining
        methods for provisioning a new slave discussed in this section
        use other means to convey information about transactions to the
        new slave.
      </p><p><a name="replication-gtids-failover-empty"></a><b>Injecting empty transactions. </b>
          The master's global
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> variable
          contains the set of all transactions executed on the master.
          Rather than copy the binary logs when taking a snapshot to
          provision a new server, you can instead note the content of
          <code class="literal">gtid_executed</code> on the server from which the
          snapshot was taken. Before adding the new server to the
          replication chain, simply commit an empty transaction on the
          new server for each transaction identifier contained in the
          master's <code class="literal">gtid_executed</code>, like this:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">SET GTID_NEXT='aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd:N';

BEGIN;
COMMIT;

SET GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC';</pre><p>
        Once all transaction identifiers have been reinstated in this
        way using empty transactions, you must flush and purge the
        slave's binary logs, as shown here, where
        <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> is the nonzero suffix of the
        current binary log file name:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">FLUSH LOGS;
PURGE BINARY LOGS TO 'master-bin.00000<em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em>';
</pre><p>
        You should do this to prevent this server from flooding the
        replication stream with false transactions in the event that it
        is later promoted to master. (The
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#flush" title="13.7.6.3. FLUSH Syntax"><code class="literal">FLUSH LOGS</code></a>
        statement forces the creation of a new binary log file;
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#purge-binary-logs" title="13.4.1.1. PURGE BINARY LOGS Syntax"><code class="literal">PURGE BINARY LOGS</code></a> purges the
        empty transactions, but retains their identifiers.)
      </p><p>
        This method creates a server that is essentially a snapshot, but
        in time is able to become a master as its binary log history
        converges with that of the replication stream (that is, as it
        catches up with the master or masters). This outcome is similar
        in effect to that obtained using the remaining provisioning
        method, which we discuss in the next few paragraphs.

<h4 class="title"><a name="replication-gtids-restrictions"></a>16.1.3.4. Restrictions on Replication with GTIDs</h4>

</div>

</div>

</div>
<p>
        Because GTID-based replication is dependent on transactions,
        some features otherwise available in MySQL are not supported
        when using it. This section provides information about
        restrictions on and limitations of replication with GTIDs.
      </p><p><b>Updates involving nontransactional storage engines. </b>
          When using GTIDs, updates to tables using nontransactional
          storage engines such as <a class="link" href="storage-engines.html#myisam-storage-engine" title="14.3. The MyISAM Storage Engine"><code class="literal">MyISAM</code></a>
          cannot made in the same statement or transaction as updates to
          tables using transactional storage engines such as
          <a class="link" href="storage-engines.html#innodb-storage-engine" title="14.2. The InnoDB Storage Engine"><code class="literal">InnoDB</code></a>.
        </p><p>
        This restriction is due to the fact that updates to using a
        nontransactional storage engine mixed with updates to tables
        that use a transactional storage engine within the same
        transaction can result in multiple GTIDs being assigned to the
        same transaction. This problem can also occur in at least two
        other cases, listed here:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            When the master and the slave use different storage engines
            for their respective versions of the same table, where one
            storage engine is transactional and the other is not.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            When both the master and the slave use a nontransactional
            engine, but use different binary logging formats (for
            example, when the master has
            <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=ROW</code></a> and the
            slave has <code class="literal">binlog_format=STATEMENT</code>).
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
        In any of the cases just mentioned, the one-to-one
        correspondence between transactions and GTIDs is broken, with
        the result that GTID-based replication cannot function
        correctly.
      </p><p><b><code class="literal">CREATE TABLE ... SELECT</code> statements. </b>
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-table-select" title="13.1.17.1. CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE
          TABLE ... SELECT</code></a> is not safe for statement-based
          replication. When using row-based replication, this statement
          is actually logged as two separate events—one for the
          creation of the table, and another for the insertion of rows
          from the source table into the new table just created. When
          this statement is executed within a transaction, it is
          possible in some cases for these two events to receive the
          same transaction identifier, which means that the transaction
          containing the inserts is skipped by the slave. Therefore,
          <code class="literal">CREATE TABLE ... SELECT</code> is not supported
          when using GTID-based replication.
        </p><p><b>Temporary tables. </b>
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-table" title="13.1.17. CREATE TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE TEMPORARY
          TABLE</code></a> and
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#drop-table" title="13.1.28. DROP TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">DROP TEMPORARY
          TABLE</code></a> statements are not supported inside
          transactions when using GTIDs (that is, when the server was
          started with the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_enforce-gtid-consistency"><code class="option">--enforce-gtid-consistency</code></a>
          option). It is possible to use use these statements with GTIDs
          enabled, but only outside of any transaction, and only with
          <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_autocommit"><code class="literal">autocommit=1</code></a>.
        </p><p><b>Preventing execution of unsupported statements. </b>
          In order to prevent execution of statements that would cause
          GTID-based replication to fail, all servers must be started
          with the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_enforce-gtid-consistency"><code class="option">--enforce-gtid-consistency</code></a>
          option when enabling GTIDs. This causes statements of any of
          the types discussed previously in this section to fail with an
          error.
        </p><p>
        For information about other required startup options when
        enabling GTIDs, see <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-gtids-howto" title="16.1.3.2. Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs">Section 16.1.3.2, “Setting Up Replication Using GTIDs”</a>.
      </p><p>
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_sql_slave_skip_counter"><code class="literal">sql_slave_skip_counter</code></a> is not
        supported when using GTIDs. If you need to skip transactions,
        use the value of the master's
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_gtid_executed"><code class="literal">gtid_executed</code></a> variable instead;
        see <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-gtids-failover-empty" title="Injecting empty transactions">Injecting empty transactions</a>, for more

<p>
    This option is common to both master and slave replication servers,
    and is used in replication to enable master and slave servers to
    identify themselves uniquely. For additional information, see
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-options-master" title="16.1.4.2. Replication Master Options and Variables">Section 16.1.4.2, “Replication Master Options and Variables”</a>, and

  </p><p>
    On the master and each slave, you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> use the
    <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_server-id"><code class="option">--server-id</code></a> option to establish a
    unique replication ID in the range from 1 to
    2<sup>32</sup> – 1. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Unique</span>”</span>,
    means that each ID must be different from every other ID in use by

    <code class="literal">server-id=3</code>.
  </p><p>
    If you omit <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_server-id"><code class="option">--server-id</code></a>, the default
    ID is 0, in which case a master refuses connections from all slaves,
    and a slave refuses to connect to a master. For more information,
    see <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto-slavebaseconfig" title="16.1.1.2. Setting the Replication Slave Configuration">Section 16.1.1.2, “Setting the Replication Slave Configuration”</a>.

    Beginning with MySQL 5.6, the server generates a true UUID in
    addition to the <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_server-id"><code class="option">--server-id</code></a> supplied
    by the user. This is available as the global, read-only variable

<p>
    When starting, the MySQL server automatically obtains a UUID as
    follows:
</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
        <a class="indexterm" name="idp98700928"></a>

        Attempt to read and use the UUID written in the file
        <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>data_dir</code></em>/auto.cnf</code>
        (where <em class="replaceable"><code>data_dir</code></em> is the server's
        data directory); exit on success.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Otherwise, generate a new UUID and save it to this file,
        creating the file if necessary.
</p></li></ol>
</div>
<p>
    The <code class="filename">auto.cnf</code> file has a format similar to that
    used for <code class="filename">my.cnf</code> or <code class="filename">my.ini</code>
    files. In MySQL 5.6, <code class="filename">auto.cnf</code> has
    only a single <code class="literal">[auto]</code> section containing a single
    <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_server_uuid"><code class="literal">server_uuid</code></a> setting and value; the
    file's contents appear similar to what is shown here:
  </p><pre class="programlisting">[auto]

<p>
    Also beginning with MySQL 5.6, when using MySQL replication, masters
    and slaves know one another's UUIDs. The value of a
    slave's UUID can be seen in the output of

          <code class="literal">AUTO_INCREMENT</code> columns for all tables into
          which new rows are inserted by the current user for the

        means that each ID must be different from every other ID in use

          Normally, a slave does not log to its own binary log any
          updates that are received from a master server. This option
          tells the slave to log the updates performed by its SQL thread
          to its own binary log. For this option to have any effect, the
          slave must also be started with the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-bin"><code class="option">--log-bin</code></a> option to enable
          binary logging. Prior to MySQL 5.5, the server would not start
          when using the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-slave-updates"><code class="option">--log-slave-updates</code></a> option
          without also starting the server with the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-bin"><code class="option">--log-bin</code></a> option, and would
          fail with an error; in MySQL 5.6, only a warning
          is generated. (Bug #44663)
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-slave-updates"><code class="option">--log-slave-updates</code></a> is used
          when you want to chain replication servers. For example, you
          might want to set up replication servers using this
          arrangement:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">A -&gt; B -&gt; C</pre><p>
          Here, <code class="literal">A</code> serves as the master for the slave
          <code class="literal">B</code>, and <code class="literal">B</code> serves as the
          master for the slave <code class="literal">C</code>. For this to work,
          <code class="literal">B</code> must be both a master
          <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> a slave. You must start both
          <code class="literal">A</code> and <code class="literal">B</code> with
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-bin"><code class="option">--log-bin</code></a> to enable binary

          This option causes a server to print more messages to the
          error log about what it is doing. With respect to replication,
          the server generates warnings that it succeeded in
          reconnecting after a network/connection failure, and informs
          you as to how each slave thread started. This option is
          enabled by default; to disable it, use
          <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#option_mysqld_log-warnings"><code class="option">--skip-log-warnings</code></a>.
          If the value is greater than 1, aborted connections are
          written to the error log, and access-denied errors for new
          connection attempts are written. See
          <a class="xref" href="error-handling.html#communication-errors" title="C.5.2.11. Communication Errors and Aborted Connections">Section C.5.2.11, “Communication Errors and Aborted Connections”</a>.

          Note that the effects of this option are not limited to

          The basename for the relay log. The default basename is
          <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>host_name</code></em>-relay-bin</code>.
          The server writes the file in the data directory unless the
          basename is given with a leading absolute path name to specify
          a different directory. The server creates relay log files in
          sequence by adding a numeric suffix to the basename.
        </p><p>
          Due to the manner in which MySQL parses server options, if you
          specify this option, you must supply a value; <span class="emphasis"><em>the
          default basename is used only if the option is not actually
          specified</em></span>. If you use the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log"><code class="option">--relay-log</code></a> option without
          specifying a value, unexpected behavior is likely to result;
          this behavior depends on the other options used, the order in
          which they are specified, and whether they are specified on
          the command line or in an option file. For more information
          about how MySQL handles server options, see
          <a class="xref" href="programs.html#program-options" title="4.2.3. Specifying Program Options">Section 4.2.3, “Specifying Program Options”</a>.
        </p><p>
          If you specify this option, the value specified is also used
          as the basename for the relay log index file. You can override
          this behavior by specifying a different relay log index file
          basename using the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-index"><code class="option">--relay-log-index</code></a> option.
        </p><p>
          Starting with MySQL 5.6.5, when the server reads an entry from
          the index file, it checks whether the entry contains a
          relative path. If it does, the relative part of the path in
          replaced with the absolute path set using the
          <code class="option">--relay-log</code> option. An absolute path remains
          unchanged; in such a case, the index must be edited manually
          to enable the new path or paths to be used. Prior to MySQL
          5.6.5, manual intervention was required whenever relocating
          the binary log or relay log files. (Bug #11745230, Bug #12133)

          The name to use for the relay log index file. The default name
          is
          <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>host_name</code></em>-relay-bin.index</code>
          in the data directory, where

          server.
        </p><p>
          Due to the manner in which MySQL parses server options, if you
          specify this option, you must supply a value; <span class="emphasis"><em>the
          default basename is used only if the option is not actually
          specified</em></span>. If you use the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-index"><code class="option">--relay-log-index</code></a> option
          without specifying a value, unexpected behavior is likely to
          result; this behavior depends on the other options used, the
          order in which they are specified, and whether they are
          specified on the command line or in an option file. For more
          information about how MySQL handles server options, see

        </p><p>
          If you specify this option, the value specified is also used
          as the basename for the relay logs. You can override this
          behavior by specifying a different relay log file basename
          using the <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log"><code class="option">--relay-log</code></a> option.

          Enables automatic relay log recovery immediately following
          server startup, which means that the replication slave
          discards all unprocessed relay logs and retrieves them from
          the replication master. This should be used following a crash
          on the replication slave to ensure that no possibly corrupted
          relay logs are processed. The default value is 0 (disabled).
          This option must be enabled in order to provide a crash-proof

<p>
          This option places an upper limit on the total size in bytes
          of all relay logs on the slave. A value of 0 means <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">no
          limit.</span>”</span> This is useful for a slave server host that has
          limited disk space. When the limit is reached, the I/O thread
          stops reading binary log events from the master server until
          the SQL thread has caught up and deleted some unused relay
          logs. Note that this limit is not absolute: There are cases
          where the SQL thread needs more events before it can delete
          relay logs. In that case, the I/O thread exceeds the limit
          until it becomes possible for the SQL thread to delete some
          relay logs because not doing so would cause a deadlock. You
          should not set
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-space-limit"><code class="option">--relay-log-space-limit</code></a> to less
          than twice the value of
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_max-relay-log-size"><code class="option">--max-relay-log-size</code></a> (or
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_max_binlog_size"><code class="option">--max-binlog-size</code></a> if
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_max-relay-log-size"><code class="option">--max-relay-log-size</code></a> is 0). In
          that case, there is a chance that the I/O thread waits for
          free space because
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-space-limit"><code class="option">--relay-log-space-limit</code></a> is
          exceeded, but the SQL thread has no relay log to purge and is
          unable to satisfy the I/O thread. This forces the I/O thread
          to ignore

          The effects of this option depend on whether statement-based
          or row-based replication is in use.

            Tell the slave SQL thread to restrict replication to

<p xmlns="">
            To specify multiple databases you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span>
            use multiple instances of this option. Because database

<p>
          An example of what does not work as you might expect when
          using statement-based replication: If the slave is started
          with <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db"><code class="option">--replicate-do-db=sales</code></a>
          and you issue the following statements on the master, the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statement is
          <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> replicated:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">USE prices;
UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;</pre><p>
          The main reason for this <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">check just the default
          database</span>”</span> behavior is that it is difficult from the
          statement alone to know whether it should be replicated (for
          example, if you are using multiple-table
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#delete" title="13.2.2. DELETE Syntax"><code class="literal">DELETE</code></a> statements or
          multiple-table <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a>
          statements that act across multiple databases). It is also
          faster to check only the default database rather than all
          databases if there is no need.
        </p><p><b>Row-based replication. </b>
            Tells the slave SQL thread to restrict replication to
            database <em class="replaceable"><code>db_name</code></em>. Only tables
            belonging to <em class="replaceable"><code>db_name</code></em> are changed;
            the current database has no effect on this. Suppose that the
            slave is started with
            <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db"><code class="option">--replicate-do-db=sales</code></a> and
            row-based replication is in effect, and then the following
            statements are run on the master:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">USE prices;
UPDATE sales.february SET amount=amount+100;</pre><p>
          The <code class="literal">february</code> table in the
          <code class="literal">sales</code> database on the slave is changed in
          accordance with the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a>
          statement; this occurs whether or not the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#use" title="13.8.4. USE Syntax"><code class="literal">USE</code></a> statement was issued.
          However, issuing the following statements on the master has no
          effect on the slave when using row-based replication and
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db"><code class="option">--replicate-do-db=sales</code></a>:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">USE prices;
UPDATE prices.march SET amount=amount-25;</pre><p>
          Even if the statement <code class="literal">USE prices</code> were
          changed to <code class="literal">USE sales</code>, the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statement's effects
          would still not be replicated.
        </p><p>
          Another important difference in how
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db"><code class="option">--replicate-do-db</code></a> is handled in
          statement-based replication as opposed to row-based
          replication occurs with regard to statements that refer to
          multiple databases. Suppose that the slave is started with
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db"><code class="option">--replicate-do-db=db1</code></a>, and the
          following statements are executed on the master:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">USE db1;
UPDATE db1.table1 SET col1 = 10, db2.table2 SET col2 = 20;</pre><p>
          If you are using statement-based replication, then both tables
          are updated on the slave. However, when using row-based
          replication, only <code class="literal">table1</code> is affected on the
          slave; since <code class="literal">table2</code> is in a different
          database, <code class="literal">table2</code> on the slave is not
          changed by the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a>. Now
          suppose that, instead of the <code class="literal">USE db1</code>
          statement, a <code class="literal">USE db4</code> statement had been
          used:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">USE db4;
UPDATE db1.table1 SET col1 = 10, db2.table2 SET col2 = 20;</pre><p>
          In this case, the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a>
          statement would have no effect on the slave when using
          statement-based replication. However, if you are using
          row-based replication, the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> would change
          <code class="literal">table1</code> on the slave, but not
          <code class="literal">table2</code>—in other words, only tables in
          the database named by
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db"><code class="option">--replicate-do-db</code></a> are changed,
          and the choice of default database has no effect on this
          behavior.
        </p><p>

<p>
          As with <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db"><code class="option">--replicate-do-db</code></a>, the
          effects of this option depend on whether statement-based or
          row-based replication is in use.
        </p><p><b>Statement-based replication. </b>
            Tells the slave SQL thread not to replicate any statement
            where the default database (that is, the one selected by
            <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#use" title="13.8.4. USE Syntax"><code class="literal">USE</code></a>) is
            <em class="replaceable"><code>db_name</code></em>.
          </p><p><b>Row-based replication. </b>
            Tells the slave SQL thread not to update any tables in the
            database <em class="replaceable"><code>db_name</code></em>. The default
            database has no effect.
          </p><p>
          When using statement-based replication, the following example
          does not work as you might expect. Suppose that the slave is
          started with
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db"><code class="option">--replicate-ignore-db=sales</code></a> and
          you issue the following statements on the master:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">USE prices;
UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;</pre><p>
          The <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statement
          <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> replicated in such a case because
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db"><code class="option">--replicate-ignore-db</code></a> applies
          only to the default database (determined by the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#use" title="13.8.4. USE Syntax"><code class="literal">USE</code></a> statement). Because the
          <code class="literal">sales</code> database was specified explicitly in
          the statement, the statement has not been filtered. However,
          when using row-based replication, the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statement's effects
          are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> propagated to the slave, and the
          slave's copy of the <code class="literal">sales.january</code>
          table is unchanged; in this instance,
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db"><code class="option">--replicate-ignore-db=sales</code></a>
          causes <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> changes made to tables in the
          master's copy of the <code class="literal">sales</code> database to
          be ignored by the slave.
        </p><p>
          To specify more than one database to ignore, use this option
          multiple times, once for each database. Because database names
          can contain commas, if you supply a comma separated list then
          the list will be treated as the name of a single database.
        </p><p>
          You should not use this option if you are using cross-database
          updates and you do not want these updates to be replicated.
          See <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-rules" title="16.2.3. How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules">Section 16.2.3, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”</a>.

          To be used on slave servers. Usually you should use the
          default setting of 0, to prevent infinite loops caused by
          circular replication. If set to 1, the slave does not skip
          events having its own server ID. Normally, this is useful only
          in rare configurations. Cannot be set to 1 if
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-slave-updates"><code class="option">--log-slave-updates</code></a> is used. By
          default, the slave I/O thread does not write binary log events

        </p><p>
          Example:
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table"><code class="option">--replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar%</code></a>
          replicates only updates that use a table where the database
          name starts with <code class="literal">foo</code> and the table name
          starts with <code class="literal">bar</code>.
        </p><p>
          If the table name pattern is <code class="literal">%</code>, it matches
          any table name and the option also applies to database-level
          statements (<a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-database" title="13.1.10. CREATE DATABASE Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE DATABASE</code></a>,
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#drop-database" title="13.1.21. DROP DATABASE Syntax"><code class="literal">DROP DATABASE</code></a>, and
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#alter-database" title="13.1.1. ALTER DATABASE Syntax"><code class="literal">ALTER DATABASE</code></a>). For example,
          if you use
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table"><code class="option">--replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.%</code></a>,
          database-level statements are replicated if the database name
          matches the pattern <code class="literal">foo%</code>.
        </p><p>
          To include literal wildcard characters in the database or
          table name patterns, escape them with a backslash. For
          example, to replicate all tables of a database that is named
          <code class="literal">my_own%db</code>, but not replicate tables from
          the <code class="literal">my1ownAABCdb</code> database, you should
          escape the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="literal">_</code></span>”</span> and
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="literal">%</code></span>”</span> characters like this:
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table"><code class="option">--replicate-wild-do-table=my\_own\%db</code></a>.
          If you use the option on the command line, you might need to
          double the backslashes or quote the option value, depending on
          your command interpreter. For example, with the
          <span class="command"><strong>bash</strong></span> shell, you would need to type
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table"><code class="option">--replicate-wild-do-table=my\\_own\\%db</code></a>.

          Tells the slave thread not to replicate a statement where any
          table matches the given wildcard pattern. To specify more than
          one table to ignore, use this option multiple times, once for
          each table. This works for cross-database updates. See
          <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-rules" title="16.2.3. How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules">Section 16.2.3, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”</a>.

          Sets the number of slave worker threads for executing
          replication events (transactions) in parallel. Setting this
          variable to 0 (the default) disables parallel execution. The
          maximum is 1024.
        </p><p>
          When parallel execution is enabled, the slave SQL thread acts
          as the coordinator for the slave worker threads, among which
          transactions are distributed on a per-database basis. This
          means that a worker thread on the slave slave can process
          successive transactions on a given database without waiting
          for updates to other databases to complete. The current
          implementation of multi-threading on the slave assumes that
          the data is partitioned per database, and that updates within
          a given database occur in the same relative order as they do
          on the master, in order to work correctly. However,
          transactions do not need to be coordinated between any two
          databases.
        </p><p>
          Due to the fact that transactions on different databases can
          occur in a different order on the slave than on the master,
          checking for the most recently executed transaction does not
          guarantee that all previous transactions from the master have
          been executed on the slave. This has implications for logging
          and recovery when using a multi-threaded slave. For
          information about how to interpret binary logging information
          when using multi-threading on the slave, see
          <a class="xref" href="sql-syntax.html#show-slave-status" title="13.7.5.35. SHOW SLAVE STATUS Syntax">Section 13.7.5.35, “<code class="literal">SHOW SLAVE STATUS</code> Syntax”</a>. In addition, this means
          that <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#start-slave" title="13.4.2.5. START SLAVE Syntax"><code class="literal">START SLAVE
          UNTIL</code></a> is not supported with a multi-threaded slave.
        </p><p>
          When multi-threading is enabled,
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_slave_transaction_retries"><code class="literal">slave_transaction_retries</code></a> is
          treated as equal to 0, and cannot be changed. (Currently,
          retrying of transactions is not supported with multi-threaded
          slaves.)
        </p><p>
          You should also note that, in MySQL 5.6.7 and later, enforcing
          foreign key relationships between tables in different
          databases causes multi-threaded slaves to use sequential
          rather than parallel mode, which can have a negative impact on
          performance. (Bug #14092635)

          temporary files in a directory located in some file system

<p>
          Normally, replication stops when an error occurs on the slave.
          This gives you the opportunity to resolve the inconsistency in
          the data manually. This option tells the slave SQL thread to
          continue replication when a statement returns any of the
          errors listed in the option value.
        </p><p>
          Do not use this option unless you fully understand why you are
          getting errors. If there are no bugs in your replication setup
          and client programs, and no bugs in MySQL itself, an error
          that stops replication should never occur. Indiscriminate use
          of this option results in slaves becoming hopelessly out of
          synchrony with the master, with you having no idea why this
          has occurred.
        </p><p>
          For error codes, you should use the numbers provided by the
          error message in your slave error log and in the output of
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#show-slave-status" title="13.7.5.35. SHOW SLAVE STATUS Syntax"><code class="literal">SHOW SLAVE STATUS</code></a>.
          <a class="xref" href="error-handling.html" title="Appendix C. Errors, Error Codes, and Common Problems">Appendix C, <i>Errors, Error Codes, and Common Problems</i></a>, lists server error codes.
        </p><p>
          You can also (but should not) use the very nonrecommended
          value of <code class="literal">all</code> to cause the slave to ignore
          all error messages and keeps going regardless of what happens.
          Needless to say, if you use <code class="literal">all</code>, there are
          no guarantees regarding the integrity of your data. Please do
          not complain (or file bug reports) in this case if the slave's
          data is not anywhere close to what it is on the master.
          <span class="emphasis"><em>You have been warned</em></span>.
        </p><p>
          MySQL 5.6 supports an additional shorthand value
          <code class="literal">ddl_exists_errors</code>, which is equivalent to
          the error code list
          <code class="literal">1007,1008,4050,1051,1054,1060,1061,1068,1094,1146</code>.

          Enables automatic relay log recovery immediately following
          server startup, which means that the replication slave
          discards all unprocessed relay logs and retrieves them from
          the replication master. In MySQL 5.6.5 and earlier, it was
          possible to change this global variable dynamically; beginning
          with MySQL 5.6.6, it is read-only. (Bug #13840948) Regardless
          of the MySQL Server version, its value can be changed by
          starting the slave with the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-recovery"><code class="option">--relay-log-recovery</code></a> option,
          which should be used following a crash on the replication
          slave to ensure that no possibly corrupted relay logs are
          processed, and must be used in order to guarantee a
          crash-proof slave. The default value is 0 (disabled).

          Sets the number of slave worker threads for executing
          replication events (transactions) in parallel. Setting this
          variable to 0 (the default) disables parallel execution. The
          maximum is 1024.
        </p><p>
          When parallel execution is enabled, the slave SQL thread acts
          as the coordinator for the slave worker threads, among which
          transactions are distributed on a per-database basis. This
          means that a worker thread on the slave slave can process
          successive transactions on a given database without waiting
          for updates to other databases to complete. The current
          implementation of multi-threading on the slave assumes that
          the data is partitioned per database, and that updates within
          a given database occur in the same relative order as they do
          on the master, in order to work correctly. However,
          transactions do not need to be coordinated between any two
          databases.
        </p><p>
          Due to the fact that transactions on different databases can
          occur in a different order on the slave than on the master,
          checking for the most recently executed transaction does not
          guarantee that all previous transactions from the master have
          been executed on the slave. This has implications for logging
          and recovery when using a multi-threaded slave. For
          information about how to interpret binary logging information
          when using multi-threading on the slave, see
          <a class="xref" href="sql-syntax.html#show-slave-status" title="13.7.5.35. SHOW SLAVE STATUS Syntax">Section 13.7.5.35, “<code class="literal">SHOW SLAVE STATUS</code> Syntax”</a>. In addition, this means

          If the value of this variable is greater than 0, the MySQL
          server synchronizes its relay log to disk (using
          <code class="literal">fdatasync()</code>) after every
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_sync_relay_log"><code class="literal">sync_relay_log</code></a> writes to the
          relay log. There is one write to the relay log per statement
          if autocommit is enabled, and one write per transaction
          otherwise. A value of 0 does no synchronizing to disk—in
          this case, the server relies on the operating system to flush
          the relay log's contents from time to time as for any
          other file. A value of 1 is the safest choice because in the
          event of a crash you lose at most one statement or transaction
          from the relay log. However, it is also the slowest choice
          (unless the disk has a battery-backed cache, which makes
          synchronization very fast). The default is 10000 as of MySQL
          5.6.6, 0 before that.

          Enable binary logging. The server logs all statements that
          change data to the binary log, which is used for backup and
          replication. See <a class="xref" href="server-administration.html#binary-log" title="5.2.4. The Binary Log">Section 5.2.4, “The Binary Log”</a>.
        </p><p>
          The option value, if given, is the basename for the log
          sequence. The server creates binary log files in sequence by
          adding a numeric suffix to the basename. It is recommended
          that you specify a basename (see <a class="xref" href="error-handling.html#bugs" title="C.5.8. Known Issues in MySQL">Section C.5.8, “Known Issues in MySQL”</a>, for
          the reason). Otherwise, MySQL uses
          <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>host_name</code></em>-bin</code>
          as the basename.
        </p><p>
          In MySQL 5.6.5 and later, when the server reads an entry from
          the index file, it checks whether the entry contains a
          relative path, and if it does, the relative part of the path
          in replaced with the absolute path set using the
          <code class="option">--log-bin</code> option. An absolute path remains
          unchanged; in such a case, the index must be edited manually
          to enable the new path or paths to be used. Previous to MySQL
          5.6.5, manual intervention was required whenever relocating
          the binary log or relay log files. (Bug #11745230, Bug #12133)
        </p><p>
          Setting this option causes the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_log_bin"><code class="literal">log_bin</code></a> system variable to be
          set to <code class="literal">ON</code> (or <code class="literal">1</code>), and
          not to the basename. Beginning with MySQL 5.6.2, the binary
          log filename (with path) is available as the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_log_bin_basename"><code class="literal">log_bin_basename</code></a> system

          Version 2 binary log row events are available beginning with
          MySQL 5.6.6; however, Version 2 events cannot be read by
          previous MySQL Server releases. Setting this option to 1
          causes <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqld" title="4.3.1. mysqld — The MySQL Server"><span class="command"><strong>mysqld</strong></span></a> to write the binary log using
          Version 1 logging events, which is the only version of binary
          log events used in previous releases, and thus produce binary
          logs that can be read by older slaves. Setting
          <code class="option">--log-bin-use-v1-row-events</code> to 0 (the

<p>
          This option affects binary logging in a manner similar to the
          way that <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db"><code class="option">--replicate-do-db</code></a>
          affects replication.
        </p><p>
          The effects of this option depend on whether the
          statement-based or row-based logging format is in use, in the
          same way that the effects of
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db"><code class="option">--replicate-do-db</code></a> depend on
          whether statement-based or row-based replication is in use.
          You should keep in mind that the format used to log a given
          statement may not necessarily be the same as that indicated by
          the value of <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format</code></a>.
          For example, DDL statements such as
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-table" title="13.1.17. CREATE TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE TABLE</code></a> and
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#alter-table" title="13.1.7. ALTER TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">ALTER TABLE</code></a> are always logged
          as statements, without regard to the logging format in effect,
          so the following statement-based rules for
          <code class="option">--binlog-do-db</code> always apply in determining
          whether or not the statement is logged.
        </p><p><b>Statement-based logging. </b>
            Only those statements are written to the binary log where
            the default database (that is, the one selected by
            <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#use" title="13.8.4. USE Syntax"><code class="literal">USE</code></a>) is
            <em class="replaceable"><code>db_name</code></em>. To specify more than one
            database, use this option multiple times, once for each
            database; however, doing so does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
            cause cross-database statements such as <code class="literal">UPDATE
            <em class="replaceable"><code>some_db.some_table</code></em> SET
            foo='bar'</code> to be logged while a different database
            (or no database) is selected.

<p xmlns="">
            To specify multiple databases you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span>
            use multiple instances of this option. Because database
            names can contain commas, the list will be treated as the
            name of a single database if you supply a comma-separated
            list.
</p>
</div>
<p>
          An example of what does not work as you might expect when
          using statement-based logging: If the server is started with
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db"><code class="option">--binlog-do-db=sales</code></a> and you
          issue the following statements, the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statement is
          <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> logged:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">USE prices;
UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;</pre><p>
          The main reason for this <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">just check the default
          database</span>”</span> behavior is that it is difficult from the
          statement alone to know whether it should be replicated (for
          example, if you are using multiple-table
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#delete" title="13.2.2. DELETE Syntax"><code class="literal">DELETE</code></a> statements or
          multiple-table <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a>
          statements that act across multiple databases). It is also
          faster to check only the default database rather than all
          databases if there is no need.
        </p><p>
          Another case which may not be self-evident occurs when a given
          database is replicated even though it was not specified when
          setting the option. If the server is started with
          <code class="option">--binlog-do-db=sales</code>, the following
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statement is logged even
          though <code class="literal">prices</code> was not included when setting
          <code class="option">--binlog-do-db</code>:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">          
USE sales;
UPDATE prices.discounts SET percentage = percentage + 10;</pre><p>
          Because <code class="literal">sales</code> is the default database when
          the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statement is issued,
          the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> is logged.
        </p><p><b>Row-based logging. </b>
            Logging is restricted to database
            <em class="replaceable"><code>db_name</code></em>. Only changes to tables
            belonging to <em class="replaceable"><code>db_name</code></em> are logged;
            the default database has no effect on this. Suppose that the
            server is started with
            <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db"><code class="option">--binlog-do-db=sales</code></a> and
            row-based logging is in effect, and then the following
            statements are executed:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">USE prices;
UPDATE sales.february SET amount=amount+100;</pre><p>
          The changes to the <code class="literal">february</code> table in the
          <code class="literal">sales</code> database are logged in accordance
          with the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statement; this
          occurs whether or not the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#use" title="13.8.4. USE Syntax"><code class="literal">USE</code></a>
          statement was issued. However, when using the row-based
          logging format and
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db"><code class="option">--binlog-do-db=sales</code></a>, changes
          made by the following <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a>
          are not logged:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">USE prices;
UPDATE prices.march SET amount=amount-25;</pre><p>
          Even if the <code class="literal">USE prices</code> statement were
          changed to <code class="literal">USE sales</code>, the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statement's effects
          would still not be written to the binary log.
        </p><p>
          Another important difference in
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db"><code class="option">--binlog-do-db</code></a> handling for
          statement-based logging as opposed to the row-based logging
          occurs with regard to statements that refer to multiple
          databases. Suppose that the server is started with
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db"><code class="option">--binlog-do-db=db1</code></a>, and the
          following statements are executed:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">USE db1;
UPDATE db1.table1 SET col1 = 10, db2.table2 SET col2 = 20;</pre><p>
          If you are using statement-based logging, the updates to both
          tables are written to the binary log. However, when using the
          row-based format, only the changes to
          <code class="literal">table1</code> are logged;
          <code class="literal">table2</code> is in a different database, so it is
          not changed by the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a>. Now
          suppose that, instead of the <code class="literal">USE db1</code>
          statement, a <code class="literal">USE db4</code> statement had been
          used:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">USE db4;
UPDATE db1.table1 SET col1 = 10, db2.table2 SET col2 = 20;</pre><p>
          In this case, the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a>
          statement is not written to the binary log when using
          statement-based logging. However, when using row-based
          logging, the change to <code class="literal">table1</code> is logged,
          but not that to <code class="literal">table2</code>—in other
          words, only changes to tables in the database named by
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db"><code class="option">--binlog-do-db</code></a> are logged, and
          the choice of default database has no effect on this behavior.

          This option affects binary logging in a manner similar to the

          affects replication.
        </p><p>
          The effects of this option depend on whether the
          statement-based or row-based logging format is in use, in the
          same way that the effects of

          whether statement-based or row-based replication is in use.
          You should keep in mind that the format used to log a given
          statement may not necessarily be the same as that indicated by
          the value of <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format</code></a>.
          For example, DDL statements such as
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-table" title="13.1.17. CREATE TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE TABLE</code></a> and
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#alter-table" title="13.1.7. ALTER TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">ALTER TABLE</code></a> are always logged

          so the following statement-based rules for

          determining whether or not the statement is logged.
        </p><p><b>Statement-based logging. </b>
            Tells the server to not log any statement where the default

            <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#use" title="13.8.4. USE Syntax"><code class="literal">USE</code></a>) is
            <em class="replaceable"><code>db_name</code></em>.
          </p><p>
          Prior to MySQL 5.6.12, this option caused any statements
          containing fully qualified table names not to be logged if
          there was no default database specified (that is, when
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#select" title="13.2.9. SELECT Syntax"><code class="literal">SELECT</code></a>
          <a class="link" href="functions.html#function_database"><code class="literal">DATABASE()</code></a> returned

          there is no default database, no
          <code class="option">--binlog-ignore-db</code> options are applied, and
          such statements are always logged. (Bug #11829838, Bug #60188)

          When using statement-based logging, the following example does
          not work as you might expect. Suppose that the server is
          started with
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db"><code class="option">--binlog-ignore-db=sales</code></a> and
          you issue the following statements:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">USE prices;
UPDATE sales.january SET amount=amount+1000;</pre><p>
          The <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statement
          <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> logged in such a case because
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db"><code class="option">--binlog-ignore-db</code></a> applies only
          to the default database (determined by the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#use" title="13.8.4. USE Syntax"><code class="literal">USE</code></a> statement). Because the
          <code class="literal">sales</code> database was specified explicitly in
          the statement, the statement has not been filtered. However,
          when using row-based logging, the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statement's effects
          are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> written to the binary log, which
          means that no changes to the <code class="literal">sales.january</code>
          table are logged; in this instance,
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db"><code class="option">--binlog-ignore-db=sales</code></a> causes
          <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> changes made to tables in the
          master's copy of the <code class="literal">sales</code> database to
          be ignored for purposes of binary logging.
        </p><p>
          To specify more than one database to ignore, use this option
          multiple times, once for each database. Because database names
          can contain commas, the list will be treated as the name of a
          single database if you supply a comma-separated list.
        </p><p>
          You should not use this option if you are using cross-database
          updates and you do not want these updates to be logged.

          When enabled, this variable causes the master to write a
          checksum for each event in the binary log.
          <code class="literal">binlog_checksum</code> supports the values
          <code class="literal">NONE</code> (disabled) and

          <code class="literal">NONE</code> before that.
        </p><p>
          When <code class="literal">binlog_checksum</code> is disabled (value
          <code class="literal">NONE</code>), the server verifies that it is
          writing only complete events to the binary log by writing and
          checking the event length (rather than a checksum) for each
          event.
        </p><p>
          Changing the value of this variable causes the binary log to

          Due to concurrency issues, a slave can become inconsistent
          when a transaction contains updates to both transactional and
          nontransactional tables. MySQL tries to preserve causality
          among these statements by writing nontransactional statements
          to the transaction cache, which is flushed upon commit.
          However, problems arise when modifications done to
          nontransactional tables on behalf of a transaction become
          immediately visible to other connections because these changes
          may not be written immediately into the binary log.

            Before enabling this variable, you must make certain that

<p xmlns="">
            While you can change the logging format at runtime, it is
            <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> recommended that you change it
            while replication is ongoing. This is due in part to the
            fact that slaves do not honor the master's
            <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format</code></a> setting; a
            given MySQL Server can change only its own logging format.
</p>
</div>
<p>
          In MySQL 5.6, the default format is
          <code class="literal">STATEMENT</code>. <span class="emphasis"><em>Exception</em></span>:
          For MySQL Cluster NDB 7.3, the default is
          <code class="literal">MIXED</code>; statement-based replication is not
          supported for MySQL Cluster.
        </p><p>
          You must have the <a class="link" href="security.html#priv_super"><code class="literal">SUPER</code></a>
          privilege to set either the global or session
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format</code></a> value.
        </p><p>
          The rules governing when changes to this variable take effect
          and how long the effect lasts are the same as for other MySQL
          server system variables. See <a class="xref" href="sql-syntax.html#set-statement" title="13.7.4. SET Syntax">Section 13.7.4, “<code class="literal">SET</code> Syntax”</a>,
          for more information.
        </p><p>
          When <code class="literal">MIXED</code> is specified, statement-based
          replication is used, except for cases where only row-based
          replication is guaranteed to lead to proper results. For
          example, this happens when statements contain user-defined
          functions (UDF) or the <a class="link" href="functions.html#function_uuid"><code class="literal">UUID()</code></a>
          function. An exception to this rule is that
          <code class="literal">MIXED</code> always uses statement-based
          replication for stored functions and triggers.
        </p><p>
          There are exceptions when you cannot switch the replication
          format at runtime:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>

              From within a transaction.
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
          Trying to switch the format in those cases results in an
          error.

          In MySQL row-based replication, each row change event contains
          two images, a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">before</span>”</span> image whose columns are
          matched against when searching for the row to be updated, and
          an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">after</span>”</span> image containing the changes.
          Normally, MySQL logs full rows (that is, all columns) for both
          the before and after images. However, it is not strictly
          necessary to include every column in both images, and we can
          often save disk, memory, and network usage by logging only
          those columns which are actually required.

<div class="admon-title">

</div>
<p xmlns="">
            When deleting a row, only the before image is logged, since
            there are no changed values to propagate following the
            deletion. When inserting a row, only the after image is
            logged, since there is no existing row to be matched. Only
            when updating a row are both the before and after images
            required, and both written to the binary log.
</p>
</div>
<p>
          For the before image, it is necessary only that the minimum
          set of columns required to uniquely identify rows is logged.
          If the table containing the row has a primary key, then only
          the primary key column or columns are written to the binary
          log. Otherwise, if the table has a unique key all of whose
          columns are <code class="literal">NOT NULL</code>, then only the columns
          in the unique key need be logged. (If the table has neither a
          primary key nor a unique key without any
          <code class="literal">NULL</code> columns, then all columns must be used
          in the before image, and logged.) In the after image, it is
          necessary to log only the columns which have actually changed.
        </p><p>
          In MySQL 5.6, you can cause the server to log full or minimal
          rows using the <code class="literal">binlog_row_image</code> system
          variable. This variable actually takes one of three possible
          values, as shown in the following list:

            This variable is not supported by MySQL Cluster; setting it

</p>
</div>
<p>
          The default value is <code class="literal">full</code>. In MySQL 5.5 and
          earlier, full row images are always used for both before
          images and after images. If you need to replicate from a MySQL
          5.6 (or later) master to a slave running a previous version of
          MySQL, the master should always use this value.
        </p><p>
          When using <code class="literal">minimal</code> or
          <code class="literal">noblob</code>, deletes and updates are guaranteed
          to work correctly for a given table if and only if the
          following conditions are true for both the source and
          destination tables:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              All columns must be present and in the same order; each
              column must use the same data type as its counterpart in
              the other table.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              The tables must have identical primary key definitions.
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
          (In other words, the tables must be identical with the
          possible exception of indexes that are not part of the
          tables' primary keys.)
        </p><p>
          If these conditions are not met, it is possible that the
          primary key column values in the destination table may prove
          insufficient to provide a unique match for a delete or update.
          In this event, no warning or error is issued; the master and
          slave silently diverge, thus breaking consistency.
        </p><p>
          Setting this variable has no effect when the binary logging

          <code class="literal">MIXED</code>, the setting for

        </p><p>
          Setting <code class="literal">binlog_row_image</code> on either the

          system variable affects row-based logging only. When enabled,
          it causes a MySQL 5.6.2 or later server to write informational
          log events such as row query log events into its binary log.
          This information can be used for debugging and related
          purposes; such as obtaining the original query issued on the
          master when it cannot be reconstructed from the row updates.
        </p><p>
          These events are normally ignored by MySQL 5.6.2 and later
          programs reading the binary log and so cause no issues when
          replicating or restoring from backup. This is not true for a

          program reading the log encounters an informational log event,
          it fails, and stops reading at that point. To make the binary
          log readable by slave replication MySQL servers and other

          This variable determines the size of the cache for the binary
          log to hold nontransactional statements issued during a
          transaction. Separate binary log transaction and statement
          caches are allocated for each client if the server supports
          any transactional storage engines and if the server has the
          binary log enabled (<a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-bin"><code class="option">--log-bin</code></a>

          If the value of this variable is greater than 0, the MySQL
          server synchronizes its binary log to disk (using

          <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_sync_binlog"><code class="literal">sync_binlog</code></a> commit groups are
          written to the binary log. The default value of
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_sync_binlog"><code class="literal">sync_binlog</code></a> is 0, which does
          no synchronizing to disk—in this case, the server relies
          on the operating system to flush the binary log's
          contents from time to time as for any other file. A value of 1
          is the safest choice because in the event of a crash you lose
          at most one commit group from the binary log. However, it is
          also the slowest choice (unless the disk has a battery-backed
          cache, which makes synchronization very fast).

      Once replication has been started it should execute without
      requiring much regular administration. Depending on your
      replication environment, you will want to check the replication
      status of each slave periodically, daily, or even more frequently.

          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <code class="literal">Seconds_Behind_Master</code>: The number of
            seconds that the slave SQL thread is behind processing the
            master binary log. A high number (or an increasing one) can
            indicate that the slave is unable to handle events from the
            master in a timely fashion.
          </p><p>
            A value of 0 for <code class="literal">Seconds_Behind_Master</code>
            can usually be interpreted as meaning that the slave has
            caught up with the master, but there are some cases where
            this is not strictly true. For example, this can occur if
            the network connection between master and slave is broken
            but the slave I/O thread has not yet noticed this—that
            is, <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_slave_net_timeout"><code class="literal">slave_net_timeout</code></a> has
            not yet elapsed.
          </p><p>
            It is also possible that transient values for
            <code class="literal">Seconds_Behind_Master</code> may not reflect the
            situation accurately. When the slave SQL thread has caught
            up on I/O, <code class="literal">Seconds_Behind_Master</code> displays
            0; but when the slave I/O thread is still queuing up a new
            event, <code class="literal">Seconds_Behind_Master</code> may show a
            large value until the SQL thread finishes executing the new
            event. This is especially likely when the events have old
            timestamps; in such cases, if you execute
            <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#show-slave-status" title="13.7.5.35. SHOW SLAVE STATUS Syntax"><code class="literal">SHOW SLAVE STATUS</code></a> several
            times in a relatively short period, you may see this value
            change back and forth repeatedly between 0 and a relatively
            large value.

      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>STOP SLAVE;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        When replication is stopped, the slave I/O thread stops reading
        events from the master binary log and writing them to the relay
        log, and the SQL thread stops reading events from the relay log
        and executing them. You can pause the I/O or SQL thread
        individually by specifying the thread type:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>STOP SLAVE IO_THREAD;</code></strong>
mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        To start execution again, use the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#start-slave" title="13.4.2.5. START SLAVE Syntax"><code class="literal">START
        SLAVE</code></a> statement:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>START SLAVE;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        To start a particular thread, specify the thread type:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>START SLAVE IO_THREAD;</code></strong>
mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>START SLAVE SQL_THREAD;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        For a slave that performs updates only by processing events from
        the master, stopping only the SQL thread can be useful if you
        want to perform a backup or other task. The I/O thread will
        continue to read events from the master but they are not
        executed. This makes it easier for the slave to catch up when
        you restart the SQL thread.
      </p><p>
        Stopping only the I/O thread enables the events in the relay log
        to be executed by the SQL thread up to the point where the relay
        log ends. This can be useful when you want to pause execution to
        catch up with events already received from the master, when you
        want to perform administration on the slave but also ensure that
        it has processed all updates to a specific point. This method
        can also be used to pause event receipt on the slave while you
        conduct administration on the master. Stopping the I/O thread
        but permitting the SQL thread to run helps ensure that there is
        not a massive backlog of events to be executed when replication
        is started again.

<a class="indexterm" name="idp103636304"></a><p>
    Replication is based on the master server keeping track of all
    changes to its databases (updates, deletes, and so on) in its binary
    log. The binary log serves as a written record of all events that
    modify database structure or content (data) from the moment the
    server was started. Typically, <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#select" title="13.2.9. SELECT Syntax"><code class="literal">SELECT</code></a>
    statements are not recorded because they modify neither database
    structure nor content.
  </p><p>
    Each slave that connects to the master requests a copy of the binary
    log. That is, it pulls the data from the master, rather than the
    master pushing the data to the slave. The slave also executes the
    events from the binary log that it receives. This has the effect of
    repeating the original changes just as they were made on the master.
    Tables are created or their structure modified, and data is
    inserted, deleted, and updated according to the changes that were
    originally made on the master.
  </p><p>
    Because each slave is independent, the replaying of the changes from
    the master's binary log occurs independently on each slave that is
    connected to the master. In addition, because each slave receives a
    copy of the binary log only by requesting it from the master, the
    slave is able to read and update the copy of the database at its own
    pace and can start and stop the replication process at will without
    affecting the ability to update to the latest database status on
    either the master or slave side.
  </p><p>
    For more information on the specifics of the replication
    implementation, see
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-implementation-details" title="16.2.1. Replication Implementation Details">Section 16.2.1, “Replication Implementation Details”</a>.
  </p><p>
    Masters and slaves report their status in respect of the replication
    process regularly so that you can monitor them. See
    <a class="xref" href="optimization.html#thread-information" title="8.12.5. Examining Thread Information">Section 8.12.5, “Examining Thread Information”</a>, for descriptions of all
    replicated-related states.
  </p><p>
    The master binary log is written to a local relay log on the slave
    before it is processed. The slave also records information about the
    current position with the master's binary log and the local relay
    log. See <a class="xref" href="replication.html#slave-logs" title="16.2.2. Replication Relay and Status Logs">Section 16.2.2, “Replication Relay and Status Logs”</a>.
  </p><p>
    Database changes are filtered on the slave according to a set of
    rules that are applied according to the various configuration
    options and variables that control event evaluation. For details on
    how these rules are applied, see
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-rules" title="16.2.3. How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules">Section 16.2.3, “How Servers Evaluate Replication Filtering Rules”</a>.

      MySQL replication capabilities are implemented using three

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><b>Binlog dump thread. </b>
            The master creates a thread to send the binary log contents
            to a slave when the slave connects. This thread can be

          </p><p>
          The binlog dump thread acquires a lock on the master's binary
          log for reading each event that is to be sent to the slave. As
          soon as the event has been read, the lock is released, even
          before the event is sent to the slave.

            The slave creates an SQL thread to read the relay log that
            is written by the slave I/O thread and execute the events
            contained therein.
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
      In the preceding description, there are three threads per
      master/slave connection. A master that has multiple slaves creates
      one binlog dump thread for each currently connected slave, and
      each slave has its own I/O and SQL threads.
    </p><p>
      A slave uses two threads to separate reading updates from the
      master and executing them into independent tasks. Thus, the task
      of reading statements is not slowed down if statement execution is
      slow. For example, if the slave server has not been running for a
      while, its I/O thread can quickly fetch all the binary log
      contents from the master when the slave starts, even if the SQL
      thread lags far behind. If the slave stops before the SQL thread
      has executed all the fetched statements, the I/O thread has at
      least fetched everything so that a safe copy of the statements is
      stored locally in the slave's relay logs, ready for execution the
      next time that the slave starts. This enables the master server to
      purge its binary logs sooner because it no longer needs to wait
      for the slave to fetch their contents.

      The <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#show-processlist" title="13.7.5.30. SHOW PROCESSLIST Syntax"><code class="literal">SHOW PROCESSLIST</code></a> statement

      During replication, a slave server creates several logs that hold
      the binary log events relayed from the master to the slave, and to
      record information about the current status and location within
      the relay log. There are three types of logs used in the process,
      listed here:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          The <span class="emphasis"><em>relay log</em></span> consists of the events read

          thread. Events in the relay log are executed on the slave as
          part of the SQL thread.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The <em class="firstterm">master info log</em> contains status and
          current configuration information for the slave's
          connection to the master. This log holds information on the
          master host name, login credentials, and coordinates
          indicating how far the slave has read from the master's binary
          log.
        </p><p>
          Prior to MySQL 5.6, this log was always a file
          (<code class="filename">master.info</code>), but in MySQL 5.6 and
          later, this log can be written to the
          <code class="literal">mysql.slave_master_info</code> table instead of a

          The <em class="firstterm">relay log info log</em> holds status

    </p><p>
      In order for replication to be crash-safe when using tables for
      logging status and relay information, the tables must use a
      transactional storage engine, such as
      <a class="link" href="storage-engines.html#innodb-storage-engine" title="14.2. The InnoDB Storage Engine"><code class="literal">InnoDB</code></a>. Beginning with MySQL 5.6.6,

<p xmlns="">
        In order to guarantee crash safety on the slave, you must also

      initialize the replication logging tables, the slave refused to
      start. In MySQL 5.6.6 and later, a warning is given when this
      occurs, but the slave is allowed to continue starting. (Bug
      #13971348) This situation is most likely to occur when upgrading
      from a version of MySQL that does not support slave logging tables
      to one in which they are supported.

</div>
<p>
        The relay log, like the binary log, consists of a set of
        numbered files containing events that describe database changes,
        and an index file that contains the names of all used relay log
        files.
      </p><p>
        The term <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">relay log file</span>”</span> generally denotes an
        individual numbered file containing database events. The term
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">relay log</span>”</span> collectively denotes the set of
        numbered relay log files plus the index file.
      </p><p>
        Relay log files have the same format as binary log files and can
        be read using <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqlbinlog" title="4.6.8. mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files"><span class="command"><strong>mysqlbinlog</strong></span></a> (see
        <a class="xref" href="programs.html#mysqlbinlog" title="4.6.8. mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files">Section 4.6.8, “<span class="command"><strong>mysqlbinlog</strong></span> — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files”</a>).
      </p><p>
        By default, relay log file names have the form
        <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>host_name</code></em>-relay-bin.<em class="replaceable"><code>nnnnnn</code></em></code>
        in the data directory, where
        <em class="replaceable"><code>host_name</code></em> is the name of the slave
        server host and <em class="replaceable"><code>nnnnnn</code></em> is a sequence
        number. Successive relay log files are created using successive
        sequence numbers, beginning with <code class="literal">000001</code>. The
        slave uses an index file to track the relay log files currently
        in use. The default relay log index file name is
        <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>host_name</code></em>-relay-bin.index</code>
        in the data directory.
      </p><p>
        The default relay log file and relay log index file names can be
        overridden with, respectively, the
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log"><code class="option">--relay-log</code></a> and
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-index"><code class="option">--relay-log-index</code></a> server options
        (see <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-options" title="16.1.4. Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables">Section 16.1.4, “Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables”</a>).
      </p><p>
        If a slave uses the default host-based relay log file names,
        changing a slave's host name after replication has been set up
        can cause replication to fail with the errors <span class="errortext">Failed
        to open the relay log</span> and <span class="errortext">Could not find
        target log during relay log initialization</span>. This is
        a known issue (see Bug #2122). If you anticipate that a slave's
        host name might change in the future (for example, if networking
        is set up on the slave such that its host name can be modified
        using DHCP), you can avoid this issue entirely by using the
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log"><code class="option">--relay-log</code></a> and
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-index"><code class="option">--relay-log-index</code></a> options to
        specify relay log file names explicitly when you initially set
        up the slave. This will make the names independent of server
        host name changes.
      </p><p>
        If you encounter the issue after replication has already begun,
        one way to work around it is to stop the slave server, prepend
        the contents of the old relay log index file to the new one, and
        then restart the slave. On a Unix system, this can be done as
        shown here:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>cat <em class="replaceable"><code>new_relay_log_name</code></em>.index &gt;&gt; <em class="replaceable"><code>old_relay_log_name</code></em>.index</code></strong>

        The SQL thread automatically deletes each relay log file as soon
        as it has executed all events in the file and no longer needs
        it. There is no explicit mechanism for deleting relay logs
        because the SQL thread takes care of doing so. However,

        A replication slave server creates two logs. By default, these
        logs are files named <code class="filename">master.info</code> and
        <code class="filename">relay-log.info</code> and created in the data

        and <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-info-file"><code class="option">--relay-log-info-file</code></a>
        options, respectively. In MySQL 5.6 and later, either or both of
        these logs can also be written to tables in the
        <code class="literal">mysql</code> database by starting the server with
        the appropriate option: use
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_master-info-repository"><code class="option">--master-info-repository</code></a> to have

      If a master server does not write a statement to its binary log,
      the statement is not replicated. If the server does log the
      statement, the statement is sent to all slaves and each slave
      determines whether to execute it or ignore it.
    </p><p>
      On the master, you can control which databases to log changes for
      by using the <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db"><code class="option">--binlog-do-db</code></a> and
      <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db"><code class="option">--binlog-ignore-db</code></a> options to
      control binary logging. For a description of the rules that
      servers use in evaluating these options, see
      <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-rules-db-options" title="16.2.3.1. Evaluation of Database-Level Replication and Binary Logging Options">Section 16.2.3.1, “Evaluation of Database-Level Replication and Binary Logging Options”</a>. You should not use
      these options to control which databases and tables are
      replicated. Instead, use filtering on the slave to control the
      events that are executed on the slave.
    </p><p>
      On the slave side, decisions about whether to execute or ignore
      statements received from the master are made according to the
      <code class="option">--replicate-*</code> options that the slave was started
      with. (See <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-options" title="16.1.4. Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables">Section 16.1.4, “Replication and Binary Logging Options and Variables”</a>.)
    </p><p>
      In the simplest case, when there are no
      <code class="option">--replicate-*</code> options, the slave executes all
      statements that it receives from the master. Otherwise, the result
      depends on the particular options given.
    </p><p>
      Database-level options
      (<a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db"><code class="option">--replicate-do-db</code></a>,
      <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db"><code class="option">--replicate-ignore-db</code></a>) are checked
      first; see <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-rules-db-options" title="16.2.3.1. Evaluation of Database-Level Replication and Binary Logging Options">Section 16.2.3.1, “Evaluation of Database-Level Replication and Binary Logging Options”</a>, for a
      description of this process. If no matching database-level options
      are found, option checking proceeds to any table-level options
      that may be in use, as discussed in
      <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-rules-table-options" title="16.2.3.2. Evaluation of Table-Level Replication Options">Section 16.2.3.2, “Evaluation of Table-Level Replication Options”</a>.
    </p><p>
      For statements affecting databases only (that is,
      <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-database" title="13.1.10. CREATE DATABASE Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE DATABASE</code></a>,
      <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#drop-database" title="13.1.21. DROP DATABASE Syntax"><code class="literal">DROP DATABASE</code></a>, and
      <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#alter-database" title="13.1.1. ALTER DATABASE Syntax"><code class="literal">ALTER DATABASE</code></a>), database-level
      options always take precedence over any
      <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table"><code class="option">--replicate-wild-do-table</code></a> options.
      In other words, for such statements,
      <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table"><code class="option">--replicate-wild-do-table</code></a> options
      are checked if and only if there are no database-level options
      that apply. This is a change in behavior from previous versions of
      MySQL, where the statement
      <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-database" title="13.1.10. CREATE DATABASE Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE DATABASE
      dbx</code></a> was not replicated if the slave had been started

      <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table"><code class="option">--replicate-wild-do-table=db%.t1</code></a>.
      (Bug #46110)
    </p><p>
      To make it easier to determine what effect an option set will
      have, it is recommended that you avoid mixing <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">do</span>”</span>
      and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">ignore</span>”</span> options, or wildcard and nonwildcard
      options.

      If any <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-rewrite-db"><code class="option">--replicate-rewrite-db</code></a>
      options were specified, they are applied before the
      <code class="option">--replicate-*</code> filtering rules are tested.

<p>
        When evaluating replication options, the slave begins by
        checking to see whether there are any
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db"><code class="option">--replicate-do-db</code></a> or
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db"><code class="option">--replicate-ignore-db</code></a> options
        that apply. When using
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-do-db"><code class="option">--binlog-do-db</code></a> or
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_binlog-ignore-db"><code class="option">--binlog-ignore-db</code></a>, the process
        is similar, but the options are checked on the master.
      </p><p>
        With statement-based replication, the default database is
        checked for a match. With row-based replication, the database
        where data is to be changed is the database that is checked.
        Regardless of the binary logging format, checking of
        database-level options proceeds as shown in the following
        diagram.

        The slave checks for and evaluates table options only if no

        First, as a preliminary condition, the slave checks whether
        statement-based replication is enabled. If so, and the statement
        occurs within a stored function, the slave executes the
        statement and exits. If row-based replication is enabled, the
        slave does not know whether a statement occurred within a stored
        function on the master, so this condition does not apply.

Note
</div>
<p xmlns="">
          For statement-based replication, replication events represent
          statements (all changes making up a given event are associated
          with a single SQL statement); for row-based replication, each
          event represents a change in a single table row (thus a single
          statement such as <code class="literal">UPDATE mytable SET mycol =
          1</code> may yield many row-based events). When viewed in
          terms of events, the process of checking table options is the
          same for both row-based and statement-based replication.
</p>
</div>
<p>
        Having reached this point, if there are no table options, the
        slave simply executes all events. If there are any
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-table"><code class="option">--replicate-do-table</code></a> or
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-do-table"><code class="option">--replicate-wild-do-table</code></a>
        options, the event must match one of these if it is to be
        executed; otherwise, it is ignored. If there are any
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-table"><code class="option">--replicate-ignore-table</code></a> or
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-ignore-table"><code class="option">--replicate-wild-ignore-table</code></a>
        options, all events are executed except those that match any of
        these options. This process is illustrated in the following
        diagram.

        usage for different combinations of replication filtering
        options.
      </p><p>
        Some typical combinations of replication filter rule types are
        given in the following table:
</p>
<div class="informaltable">
<table summary="This table shows typical combinations of replication
          filter rule types and describes the outcome of each." border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th scope="col">Condition (Types of Options)</th><th scope="col">Outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td scope="row">No <code class="option">--replicate-*</code> options at all:</td><td>The slave executes all events that it receives from the master.</td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><code class="option">--replicate-*-db</code> options, but no table options:</td><td>The slave accepts or ignores events using the database options. It
                executes all events permitted by those options because
                there are no table restrictions.</td></tr><tr><td scope="row"><code class="option">--replicate-*-table</code> options, but no database options:</td><td>All events are accepted at the database-checking stage because there are
                no database conditions. The slave executes or ignores
                events based solely on the table options.</td></tr><tr><td scope="row">A combination of database and table options:</td><td>The slave accepts or ignores events using the database options. Then it
                evaluates all events permitted by those options
                according to the table options. This can sometimes lead
                to results that seem counterintuitive, and that may be
                different depending on whether you are using
                statement-based or row-based replication; see the text
for an example.</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
<p>
        A more complex example follows, in which we examine the outcomes
        for both statement-based and row-based settings.
      </p><p>
        Suppose that we have two tables <code class="literal">mytbl1</code> in
        database <code class="literal">db1</code> and <code class="literal">mytbl2</code> in
        database <code class="literal">db2</code> on the master, and the slave is
        running with the following options (and no other replication
        filtering options):
      </p><pre class="programlisting">replicate-ignore-db = db1
replicate-do-table  = db2.tbl2</pre><p>
        Now we execute the following statements on the master:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">USE db1;
INSERT INTO db2.tbl2 VALUES (1);</pre><p>
        The results on the slave vary considerably depending on the
        binary log format, and may not match initial expectations in
        either case.
      </p><p><b>Statement-based replication. </b>
          The <code class="literal">USE</code> statement causes
          <code class="literal">db1</code> to be the default database. Thus the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db"><code class="option">--replicate-ignore-db</code></a> option
          matches, <span class="emphasis"><em>and the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#insert" title="13.2.5. INSERT Syntax"><code class="literal">INSERT</code></a> statement is
          ignored</em></span>. The table options are not checked.
        </p><p><b>Row-based replication. </b>
          The default database has no effect on how the slave reads
          database options when using row-based replication. Thus, the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#use" title="13.8.4. USE Syntax"><code class="literal">USE</code></a> statement makes no
          difference in how the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db"><code class="option">--replicate-ignore-db</code></a> option is
          handled: the database specified by this option does not match
          the database where the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#insert" title="13.2.5. INSERT Syntax"><code class="literal">INSERT</code></a>
          statement changes data, so the slave proceeds to check the
          table options. The table specified by
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-table"><code class="option">--replicate-do-table</code></a> matches
          the table to be updated, <span class="emphasis"><em>and the row is
          inserted</em></span>.

    Replication can be used in many different environments for a range
    of purposes. This section provides general notes and advice on using
    replication for specific solution types.
  </p><p>
    For information on using replication in a backup environment,
    including notes on the setup, backup procedure, and files to back
    up, see <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-solutions-backups" title="16.3.1. Using Replication for Backups">Section 16.3.1, “Using Replication for Backups”</a>.

  </p><p>
    Using replication as a scale-out solution requires some changes in
    the logic and operation of applications that use the solution. See
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-solutions-scaleout" title="16.3.3. Using Replication for Scale-Out">Section 16.3.3, “Using Replication for Scale-Out”</a>.
  </p><p>
    For performance or data distribution reasons, you may want to
    replicate different databases to different replication slaves. See
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-solutions-partitioning" title="16.3.4. Replicating Different Databases to Different Slaves">Section 16.3.4, “Replicating Different Databases to Different Slaves”</a>
  </p><p>
    As the number of replication slaves increases, the load on the
    master can increase and lead to reduced performance (because of the
    need to replicate the binary log to each slave). For tips on
    improving your replication performance, including using a single
    secondary server as an replication master, see
    <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-solutions-performance" title="16.3.5. Improving Replication Performance">Section 16.3.5, “Improving Replication Performance”</a>.

    the communication channel. For step-by-step instructions, see

      To use replication as a backup solution, replicate data from the
      master to a slave, and then back up the data slave. The slave can
      be paused and shut down without affecting the running operation of
      the master, so you can produce an effective snapshot of
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">live</span>”</span> data that would otherwise require the master
      to be shut down.
    </p><p>
      How you back up a database depends on its size and whether you are
      backing up only the data, or the data and the replication slave
      state so that you can rebuild the slave in the event of failure.
      There are therefore two choices:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          If you are using replication as a solution to enable you to
          back up the data on the master, and the size of your database
          is not too large, the <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a> tool may be
          suitable. See

          For larger databases, where <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a> would
          be impractical or inefficient, you can back up the raw data
          files instead. Using the raw data files option also means that
          you can back up the binary and relay logs that will enable you
          to recreate the slave in the event of a slave failure. For
          more information, see

<p>
      Another backup strategy, which can be used for either master or
      slave servers, is to put the server in a read-only state. The
      backup is performed against the read-only server, which then is
      changed back to its usual read/write operational status. See
      <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-solutions-backups-read-only" title="16.3.1.3. Backing Up a Master or Slave by Making It Read Only">Section 16.3.1.3, “Backing Up a Master or Slave by Making It Read Only”</a>.

        Using <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a> to create a copy of a
        database enables you to capture all of the data in the database
        in a format that enables the information to be imported into
        another instance of MySQL Server (see
        <a class="xref" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program">Section 4.5.4, “<span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span> — A Database Backup Program”</a>). Because the format of the
        information is SQL statements, the file can easily be
        distributed and applied to running servers in the event that you
        need access to the data in an emergency. However, if the size of
        your data set is very large, <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a> may be
        impractical.
      </p><p>
        When using <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a>, you should stop
        replication on the slave before starting the dump process to
        ensure that the dump contains a consistent set of data:
</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            Stop the slave from processing requests. You can stop
            replication completely on the slave using
            <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqladmin" title="4.5.2. mysqladmin — Client for Administering a MySQL Server"><span class="command"><strong>mysqladmin</strong></span></a>:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>mysqladmin stop-slave</code></strong></pre><p>

          </p><pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>mysql -e 'STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD;'</code></strong></pre><p>
            This enables the slave to continue to receive data change
            events from the master's binary log and store them in the
            relay logs using the I/O thread, but prevents the slave from
            executing these events and changing its data. Within busy
            replication environments, permitting the I/O thread to run
            during backup may speed up the catch-up process when you
            restart the slave SQL thread.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Run <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a> to dump your databases. You
            may either dump all databases or select databases to be
            dumped. For example, to dump all databases:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>mysqldump --all-databases &gt; fulldb.dump</code></strong></pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Once the dump has completed, start slave operations again:

<p>
        In the preceding example, you may want to add login credentials
        (user name, password) to the commands, and bundle the process up
        into a script that you can run automatically each day.
      </p><p>
        If you use this approach, make sure you monitor the slave
        replication process to ensure that the time taken to run the
        backup does not affect the slave's ability to keep up with
        events from the master. See
        <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-administration-status" title="16.1.5.1. Checking Replication Status">Section 16.1.5.1, “Checking Replication Status”</a>. If the
        slave is unable to keep up, you may want to add another slave
        and distribute the backup process. For an example of how to
        configure this scenario, see

<p>
        To guarantee the integrity of the files that are copied, backing
        up the raw data files on your MySQL replication slave should
        take place while your slave server is shut down. If the MySQL
        server is still running, background tasks may still be updating
        the database files, particularly those involving storage engines
        with background processes such as <code class="literal">InnoDB</code>.
        With <code class="literal">InnoDB</code>, these problems should be
        resolved during crash recovery, but since the slave server can
        be shut down during the backup process without affecting the
        execution of the master it makes sense to take advantage of this
        capability.
      </p><p>
        To shut down the server and back up the files:
</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
            Shut down the slave MySQL server:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>mysqladmin shutdown</code></strong></pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Copy the data files. You can use any suitable copying or
            archive utility, including <span class="command"><strong>cp</strong></span>,
            <span class="command"><strong>tar</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>WinZip</strong></span>. For
            example, assuming that the data directory is located under
            the current directory, you can archive the entire directory
            as follows:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>tar cf /tmp/dbbackup.tar ./data</code></strong></pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Start the MySQL server again. Under Unix:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">shell&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>mysqld_safe &amp;</code></strong></pre><p>

</div>
<p>
        Normally you should back up the entire data directory for the
        slave MySQL server. If you want to be able to restore the data
        and operate as a slave (for example, in the event of failure of
        the slave), then in addition to the slave's data, you should
        also back up the slave status files, the master info and relay
        log info repositories, and the relay log files. These files are
        needed to resume replication after you restore the slave's
        data.
      </p><p>
        If you lose the relay logs but still have the
        <code class="filename">relay-log.info</code> file, you can check it to
        determine how far the SQL thread has executed in the master
        binary logs. Then you can use <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#change-master-to" title="13.4.2.1. CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"><code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER
        TO</code></a> with the <code class="literal">MASTER_LOG_FILE</code> and
        <code class="literal">MASTER_LOG_POS</code> options to tell the slave to
        re-read the binary logs from that point. This requires that the
        binary logs still exist on the master server.
      </p><p>
        If your slave is replicating
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#load-data" title="13.2.6. LOAD DATA INFILE Syntax"><code class="literal">LOAD DATA
        INFILE</code></a> statements, you should also back up any
        <code class="filename">SQL_LOAD-*</code> files that exist in the
        directory that the slave uses for this purpose. The slave needs
        these files to resume replication of any interrupted
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#load-data" title="13.2.6. LOAD DATA INFILE Syntax"><code class="literal">LOAD DATA
        INFILE</code></a> operations. The location of this directory is
        the value of the
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_slave-load-tmpdir"><code class="option">--slave-load-tmpdir</code></a> option. If
        the server was not started with that option, the directory

        It is possible to back up either master or slave servers in a

        manipulating the <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_read_only"><code class="literal">read_only</code></a>

</div>
<p xmlns="">
          The instructions in this section place the server to be backed
          up in a state that is safe for backup methods that get the
          data from the server, such as <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a>
          (see <a class="xref" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program">Section 4.5.4, “<span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span> — A Database Backup Program”</a>). You should not attempt to
          use these instructions to make a binary backup by copying
          files directly because the server may still have modified data
          cached in memory and not flushed to disk.
</p>
</div>
<p>
        The following instructions describe how to do this for a master
        server and for a slave server. For both scenarios discussed
        here, suppose that you have the following replication setup:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            A master server M1
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            A slave server S1 that has M1 as its master
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            A client C1 connected to M1
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            A client C2 connected to S1
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
        In either scenario, the statements to acquire the global read
        lock and manipulate the
        <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_read_only"><code class="literal">read_only</code></a> variable are
        performed on the server to be backed up and do not propagate to
        any slaves of that server.
      </p><p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>Scenario 1: Backup with a Read-Only
        Master</strong></span>
      </p><p>
        Put the master M1 in a read-only state by executing these
        statements on it:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;</code></strong>
mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SET GLOBAL read_only = ON;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        While M1 is in a read-only state, the following properties are
        true:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            Requests for updates sent by C1 to M1 will block because the
            server is in read-only mode.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Requests for query results sent by C1 to M1 will succeed.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Making a backup on M1 is safe.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Making a backup on S1 is not safe. This server is still
            running, and might be processing the binary log or update
            requests coming from client C2
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
        While M1 is read only, perform the backup. For example, you can
        use <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a>.
      </p><p>
        After the backup operation on M1 completes, restore M1 to its
        normal operational state by executing these statements:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SET GLOBAL read_only = OFF;</code></strong>
mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>UNLOCK TABLES;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        Although performing the backup on M1 is safe (as far as the
        backup is concerned), it is not optimal for performance because
        clients of M1 are blocked from executing updates.
      </p><p>
        This strategy applies to backing up a master server in a
        replication setup, but can also be used for a single server in a
        nonreplication setting.
      </p><p>
        <span class="bold"><strong>Scenario 2: Backup with a Read-Only
        Slave</strong></span>
      </p><p>
        Put the slave S1 in a read-only state by executing these
        statements on it:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;</code></strong>
mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SET GLOBAL read_only = ON;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        While S1 is in a read-only state, the following properties are
        true:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            The master M1 will continue to operate, so making a backup
            on the master is not safe.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The slave S1 is stopped, so making a backup on the slave S1
            is safe.
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
        These properties provide the basis for a popular backup
        scenario: Having one slave busy performing a backup for a while
        is not a problem because it does not affect the entire network,
        and the system is still running during the backup. In
        particular, clients can still perform updates on the master
        server, which remains unaffected by backup activity on the
        slave.
      </p><p>
        While S1 is read only, perform the backup. For example, you can
        use <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a>.
      </p><p>
        After the backup operation on S1 completes, restore S1 to its
        normal operational state by executing these statements:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SET GLOBAL read_only = OFF;</code></strong>
mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>UNLOCK TABLES;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        After the slave is restored to normal operation, it again
        synchronizes to the master by catching up with any outstanding
        updates from the binary log of the master.

</div>

</div>

</div>
<p>
      It does not matter for the replication process whether the source
      table on the master and the replicated table on the slave use
      different engine types. In fact, the
      <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_default_storage_engine"><code class="literal">default_storage_engine</code></a> and
      <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_storage_engine"><code class="literal">storage_engine</code></a> system variables
      are not replicated.
    </p><p>
      This provides a number of benefits in the replication process in
      that you can take advantage of different engine types for
      different replication scenarios. For example, in a typical
      scale-out scenario (see
      <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-solutions-scaleout" title="16.3.3. Using Replication for Scale-Out">Section 16.3.3, “Using Replication for Scale-Out”</a>), you want to use
      <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> tables on the master to take advantage
      of the transactional functionality, but use
      <code class="literal">MyISAM</code> on the slaves where transaction support
      is not required because the data is only read. When using
      replication in a data-logging environment you may want to use the
      <code class="literal">Archive</code> storage engine on the slave.
    </p><p>
      Configuring different engines on the master and slave depends on
      how you set up the initial replication process:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          If you used <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a> to create the
          database snapshot on your master, you could edit the dump file
          text to change the engine type used on each table.
        </p><p>
          Another alternative for <a class="link" href="programs.html#mysqldump" title="4.5.4. mysqldump — A Database Backup Program"><span class="command"><strong>mysqldump</strong></span></a> is to
          disable engine types that you do not want to use on the slave
          before using the dump to build the data on the slave. For
          example, you can add the
          <a class="link" href="storage-engines.html#option_mysqld_innodb"><code class="option">--skip-innodb</code></a>
          option on your slave to disable the <code class="literal">InnoDB</code>
          engine. If a specific engine does not exist for a table to be
          created, MySQL will use the default engine type, usually
          <code class="literal">MyISAM</code>. (This requires that the
          <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sqlmode_no_engine_substitution"><code class="literal">NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION</code></a> SQL
          mode is not enabled.) If you want to disable additional
          engines in this way, you may want to consider building a
          special binary to be used on the slave that only supports the
          engines you want.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If you are using raw data files (a binary backup) to set up
          the slave, you will be unable to change the initial table
          format. Instead, use <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#alter-table" title="13.1.7. ALTER TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">ALTER

<p>
      If you are already running a replication solution and want to

</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
          Stop the slave from running replication updates:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>STOP SLAVE;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
          This will enable you to change engine types without
          interruptions.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Execute an <code class="literal">ALTER TABLE ...
          ENGINE='<em class="replaceable"><code>engine_type</code></em>'</code> for
          each table to be changed.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Start the slave replication process again:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>START SLAVE;</code></strong>
</pre></li></ol>
</div>
<p>
      Although the
      <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_default_storage_engine"><code class="literal">default_storage_engine</code></a> variable
      is not replicated, be aware that <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-table" title="13.1.17. CREATE TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE
      TABLE</code></a> and <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#alter-table" title="13.1.7. ALTER TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">ALTER TABLE</code></a>
      statements that include the engine specification will be correctly
      replicated to the slave. For example, if you have a CSV table and
      you execute:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>ALTER TABLE csvtable Engine='MyISAM';</code></strong>
</pre><p>
      The above statement will be replicated to the slave and the engine
      type on the slave will be converted to <code class="literal">MyISAM</code>,
      even if you have previously changed the table type on the slave to
      an engine other than CSV. If you want to retain engine differences
      on the master and slave, you should be careful to use the
      <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_default_storage_engine"><code class="literal">default_storage_engine</code></a> variable
      on the master when creating a new table. For example, instead of:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE tablea (columna int) Engine=MyISAM;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
      Use this format:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SET default_storage_engine=MyISAM;</code></strong>
mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE tablea (columna int);</code></strong>
</pre><p>
      When replicated, the
      <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_default_storage_engine"><code class="literal">default_storage_engine</code></a> variable
      will be ignored, and the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-table" title="13.1.17. CREATE TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE
      TABLE</code></a> statement will execute on the slave using the
      slave's default engine.

<h3 class="title"><a name="replication-solutions-scaleout"></a>16.3.3. Using Replication for Scale-Out</h3>

</div>

</div>

</div>
<p>
      You can use replication as a scale-out solution; that is, where
      you want to split up the load of database queries across multiple
      database servers, within some reasonable limitations.
    </p><p>
      Because replication works from the distribution of one master to
      one or more slaves, using replication for scale-out works best in
      an environment where you have a high number of reads and low
      number of writes/updates. Most Web sites fit into this category,
      where users are browsing the Web site, reading articles, posts, or
      viewing products. Updates only occur during session management, or
      when making a purchase or adding a comment/message to a forum.
    </p><p>
      Replication in this situation enables you to distribute the reads
      over the replication slaves, while still enabling your web servers
      to communicate with the replication master when a write is
      required. You can see a sample replication layout for this
      scenario in <a class="xref" href="replication.html#figure_replication-scaleout" title="Figure 16.1. Using Replication to Improve Performance During Scale-Out">Figure 16.1, “Using Replication to Improve Performance During Scale-Out”</a>.

      If the part of your code that is responsible for database access
      has been properly abstracted/modularized, converting it to run
      with a replicated setup should be very smooth and easy. Change the
      implementation of your database access to send all writes to the
      master, and to send reads to either the master or a slave. If your
      code does not have this level of abstraction, setting up a
      replicated system gives you the opportunity and motivation to
      clean it up. Start by creating a wrapper library or module that
      implements the following functions:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          <code class="literal">safe_writer_connect()</code>
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          <code class="literal">safe_reader_connect()</code>
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          <code class="literal">safe_reader_statement()</code>
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          <code class="literal">safe_writer_statement()</code>
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
      <code class="literal">safe_</code> in each function name means that the
      function takes care of handling all error conditions. You can use
      different names for the functions. The important thing is to have
      a unified interface for connecting for reads, connecting for
      writes, doing a read, and doing a write.
    </p><p>
      Then convert your client code to use the wrapper library. This may
      be a painful and scary process at first, but it pays off in the
      long run. All applications that use the approach just described
      are able to take advantage of a master/slave configuration, even
      one involving multiple slaves. The code is much easier to
      maintain, and adding troubleshooting options is trivial. You need
      modify only one or two functions; for example, to log how long
      each statement took, or which statement among those issued gave
      you an error.
    </p><p>
      If you have written a lot of code, you may want to automate the
      conversion task by using the <a class="link" href="programs.html#replace-utility" title="4.8.2. replace — A String-Replacement Utility"><span class="command"><strong>replace</strong></span></a> utility
      that comes with standard MySQL distributions, or write your own
      conversion script. Ideally, your code uses consistent programming
      style conventions. If not, then you are probably better off
      rewriting it anyway, or at least going through and manually
      regularizing it to use a consistent style.

<p>
      There may be situations where you have a single master and want to
      replicate different databases to different slaves. For example,
      you may want to distribute different sales data to different
      departments to help spread the load during data analysis. A sample

      You can achieve this separation by configuring the master and

<h3 class="title"><a name="replication-solutions-performance"></a>16.3.5. Improving Replication Performance</h3>

</div>

</div>

</div>
<p>
      As the number of slaves connecting to a master increases, the
      load, although minimal, also increases, as each slave uses a
      client connection to the master. Also, as each slave must receive
      a full copy of the master binary log, the network load on the
      master may also increase and create a bottleneck.
    </p><p>
      If you are using a large number of slaves connected to one master,
      and that master is also busy processing requests (for example, as
      part of a scale-out solution), then you may want to improve the
      performance of the replication process.
    </p><p>
      One way to improve the performance of the replication process is
      to create a deeper replication structure that enables the master
      to replicate to only one slave, and for the remaining slaves to
      connect to this primary slave for their individual replication
      requirements. A sample of this structure is shown in
      <a class="xref" href="replication.html#figure_replication-performance" title="Figure 16.3. Using an Additional Replication Host to Improve Performance">Figure 16.3, “Using an Additional Replication Host to Improve Performance”</a>.

</div>

</div>
<br class="figure-break"><p>
      For this to work, you must configure the MySQL instances as
      follows:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          Master 1 is the primary master where all changes and updates
          are written to the database. Binary logging should be enabled
          on this machine.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Master 2 is the slave to the Master 1 that provides the
          replication functionality to the remainder of the slaves in
          the replication structure. Master 2 is the only machine
          permitted to connect to Master 1. Master 2 also has binary
          logging enabled, and the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-slave-updates"><code class="option">--log-slave-updates</code></a> option so
          that replication instructions from Master 1 are also written
          to Master 2's binary log so that they can then be replicated
          to the true slaves.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Slave 1, Slave 2, and Slave 3 act as slaves to Master 2, and
          replicate the information from Master 2, which actually
          consists of the upgrades logged on Master 1.
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
      The above solution reduces the client load and the network
      interface load on the primary master, which should improve the
      overall performance of the primary master when used as a direct
      database solution.
    </p><p>
      If your slaves are having trouble keeping up with the replication
      process on the master, there are a number of options available:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          If possible, put the relay logs and the data files on
          different physical drives. To do this, use the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_relay-log"><code class="option">--relay-log</code></a> option to specify
          the location of the relay log.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If the slaves are significantly slower than the master, you
          may want to divide up the responsibility for replicating

          If your master makes use of transactions and you are not

          on the slaves. See

          If your slaves are not acting as masters, and you have a

</div>

</div>
<p>
      There is currently no official solution for providing failover
      between master and slaves in the event of a failure. With the
      currently available features, you would have to set up a master
      and a slave (or several slaves), and to write a script that
      monitors the master to check whether it is up. Then instruct your
      applications and the slaves to change master in case of failure.
    </p><p>
      Remember that you can tell a slave to change its master at any
      time, using the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#change-master-to" title="13.4.2.1. CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"><code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER TO</code></a>
      statement. The slave will not check whether the databases on the
      master are compatible with the slave, it will just start reading
      and executing events from the specified binary log coordinates on
      the new master. In a failover situation, all the servers in the
      group are typically executing the same events from the same binary
      log file, so changing the source of the events should not affect
      the database structure or integrity providing you are careful.
    </p><p>
      Run your slaves with the <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-bin"><code class="option">--log-bin</code></a>
      option and without
      <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-slave-updates"><code class="option">--log-slave-updates</code></a>. In this way,
      the slave is ready to become a master as soon as you issue
      <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#stop-slave" title="13.4.2.6. STOP SLAVE Syntax"><code class="literal">STOP SLAVE</code></a>;

      Each MySQL Slave (<code class="literal">Slave 1</code>, <code class="literal">Slave

      <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-slave-updates"><code class="option">--log-slave-updates</code></a>. Because

      <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-slave-updates"><code class="option">--log-slave-updates</code></a> is specified,
      the binary log on each slave is empty initially. If for some
      reason <code class="literal">MySQL Master</code> becomes unavailable, you
      can pick one of the slaves to become the new master. For example,
      if you pick <code class="literal">Slave 1</code>, all <code class="literal">Web

      The reason for running the slave without

      enabled. Then it will write updates that it receives from
      <code class="literal">Master</code> to its own binary log. When
      <code class="literal">Slave 2</code> changes from <code class="literal">Master</code>
      to <code class="literal">Slave 1</code> as its master, it may receive
      updates from <code class="literal">Slave 1</code> that it has already
      received from <code class="literal">Master</code>
    </p><p>
      Make sure that all slaves have processed any statements in their

      master, issue <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#stop-slave" title="13.4.2.6. STOP SLAVE Syntax"><code class="literal">STOP SLAVE</code></a> and
      <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#reset-master" title="13.4.1.2. RESET MASTER Syntax"><code class="literal">RESET MASTER</code></a>.
    </p><p>
      On the other slaves <code class="literal">Slave 2</code> and <code class="literal">Slave

      <code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='Slave1'</code> (where
      <code class="literal">'Slave1'</code> represents the real host name of
      <code class="literal">Slave 1</code>). To use <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#change-master-to" title="13.4.2.1. CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"><code class="literal">CHANGE
      MASTER TO</code></a>, add all information about how to connect to

      <code class="literal">Slave 3</code> (<em class="replaceable"><code>user</code></em>,
      <em class="replaceable"><code>password</code></em>,

      MASTER TO</code></a>, there is no need to specify the name of the
      <code class="literal">Slave 1</code> binary log file or log position to read
      from: We know it is the first binary log file and position 4,
      which are the defaults for <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#change-master-to" title="13.4.2.1. CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"><code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER

    </p><p>
      Once the new replication is in place, you will then need to
      instruct each <code class="literal">Web Client</code> to direct its
      statements to <code class="literal">Slave 1</code>. From that point on, all
      updates statements sent by <code class="literal">Web Client</code> to
      <code class="literal">Slave 1</code> are written to the binary log of
      <code class="literal">Slave 1</code>, which then contains every update

    </p><p>
      To make <code class="literal">Master</code> a master again (for example,

    </p><p>
      Note that there is no synchronization between the different slaves
      to a master. Some slaves might be ahead of others. This means that
      the concept outlined in the previous example might not work. In
      practice, however, the relay logs of different slaves will most
      likely not be far behind the master, so it would work, anyway (but
      there is no guarantee).
    </p><p>
      A good way to keep your applications informed as to the location
      of the master is by having a dynamic DNS entry for the master.
      With <code class="literal">bind</code> you can use
      <code class="filename">nsupdate</code> to dynamically update your DNS.

</div>

</div>

</div>
<p>
      To use SSL for encrypting the transfer of the binary log required
      during replication, both the master and the slave must support SSL
      network connections. If either host does not support SSL
      connections (because it has not been compiled or configured for
      SSL), replication through an SSL connection is not possible.
    </p><p>
      Setting up replication using an SSL connection is similar to
      setting up a server and client using SSL. You must obtain (or
      create) a suitable security certificate that you can use on the
      master, and a similar certificate (from the same certificate
      authority) on each slave.
    </p><p>
      For more information on setting up a server and client for SSL
      connectivity, see <a class="xref" href="security.html#configuring-for-ssl" title="6.3.9.2. Configuring MySQL for SSL">Section 6.3.9.2, “Configuring MySQL for SSL”</a>.
    </p><p>
      To enable SSL on the master you must create or obtain suitable
      certificates, and then add the following configuration options to
      the master's configuration within the <code class="literal">[mysqld]</code>
      section of the master's <code class="filename">my.cnf</code> file:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">[mysqld]
ssl-ca=<em class="replaceable"><code>cacert.pem</code></em>
ssl-cert=<em class="replaceable"><code>server-cert.pem</code></em>
ssl-key=<em class="replaceable"><code>server-key.pem</code></em>
</pre><p>
      The paths to the certificates may be relative or absolute; we
      recommend that you always use complete paths for this purpose.
    </p><p>
      The options are as follows:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          <code class="literal">ssl-ca</code> identifies the Certificate Authority
          (CA) certificate.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          <code class="literal">ssl-cert</code> identifies the server public key.
          This can be sent to the client and authenticated against the
          CA certificate that it has.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          <code class="literal">ssl-key</code> identifies the server private key.
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
      On the slave, you have two options available for setting the SSL
      information. You can either add the slave certificates to the
      <code class="literal">[client]</code> section of the slave's
      <code class="filename">my.cnf</code> file, or you can explicitly specify
      the SSL information using the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#change-master-to" title="13.4.2.1. CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"><code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER
      TO</code></a> statement:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          To add the slave certificates using an option file, add the

        </p><pre class="programlisting">[client]

      In addition to the built-in asynchronous replication, MySQL
      5.6 supports an interface to semisynchronous
      replication that is implemented by plugins. This section discusses
      what semisynchronous replication is and how it works. The
      following sections cover the administrative interface to
      semisynchronous replication and how to install, configure, and
      monitor it.
    </p><p>
      MySQL replication by default is asynchronous. The master writes
      events to its binary log but does not know whether or when a slave
      has retrieved and processed them. With asynchronous replication,
      if the master crashes, transactions that it has committed might
      not have been transmitted to any slave. Consequently, failover
      from master to slave in this case may result in failover to a
      server that is missing transactions relative to the master.
    </p><p>
      Semisynchronous replication can be used as an alternative to
      asynchronous replication:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          A slave indicates whether it is semisynchronous-capable when
          it connects to the master.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If semisynchronous replication is enabled on the master side
          and there is at least one semisynchronous slave, a thread that
          performs a transaction commit on the master blocks after the
          commit is done and waits until at least one semisynchronous
          slave acknowledges that it has received all events for the
          transaction, or until a timeout occurs.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The slave acknowledges receipt of a transaction's events only
          after the events have been written to its relay log and
          flushed to disk.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          If a timeout occurs without any slave having acknowledged the
          transaction, the master reverts to asynchronous replication.
          When at least one semisynchronous slave catches up, the master
          returns to semisynchronous replication.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Semisynchronous replication must be enabled on both the master
          and slave sides. If semisynchronous replication is disabled on
          the master, or enabled on the master but on no slaves, the
          master uses asynchronous replication.
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
      While the master is blocking (waiting for acknowledgment from a
      slave after having performed a commit), it does not return to the
      session that performed the transaction. When the block ends, the
      master returns to the session, which then can proceed to execute
      other statements. At this point, the transaction has committed on
      the master side, and receipt of its events has been acknowledged
      by at least one slave.
    </p><p>
      Blocking also occurs after rollbacks that are written to the
      binary log, which occurs when a transaction that modifies
      nontransactional tables is rolled back. The rolled-back
      transaction is logged even though it has no effect for
      transactional tables because the modifications to the
      nontransactional tables cannot be rolled back and must be sent to
      slaves.
    </p><p>
      For statements that do not occur in transactional context (that
      is, when no transaction has been started with
      <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#commit" title="13.3.1. START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Syntax"><code class="literal">START
      TRANSACTION</code></a> or
      <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#set-statement" title="13.7.4. SET Syntax"><code class="literal">SET autocommit =
      0</code></a>), autocommit is enabled and each statement commits
      implicitly. With semisynchronous replication, the master blocks
      after committing each such statement, just as it does for explicit
      transaction commits.
    </p><p>
      To understand what the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">semi</span>”</span> in
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">semisynchronous replication</span>”</span> means, compare it with
      asynchronous and fully synchronous replication:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          With asynchronous replication, the master writes events to its
          binary log and slaves request them when they are ready. There
          is no guarantee that any event will ever reach any slave.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          With fully synchronous replication, when a master commits a
          transaction, all slaves also will have committed the
          transaction before the master returns to the session that
          performed the transaction. The drawback of this is that there
          might be a lot of delay to complete a transaction.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Semisynchronous replication falls between asynchronous and
          fully synchronous replication. The master waits after commit
          only until at least one slave has received and logged the
          events. It does not wait for all slaves to acknowledge
          receipt, and it requires only receipt, not that the events
          have been fully executed and committed on the slave side.
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
      Compared to asynchronous replication, semisynchronous replication
      provides improved data integrity. When a commit returns
      successfully, it is known that the data exists in at least two
      places (on the master and at least one slave). If the master
      commits but a crash occurs while the master is waiting for
      acknowledgment from a slave, it is possible that the transaction
      may not have reached any slave.
    </p><p>
      Semisynchronous replication also places a rate limit on busy
      sessions by constraining the speed at which binary log events can
      be sent from master to slave. When one user is too busy, this will
      slow it down, which is useful in some deployment situations.
    </p><p>
      Semisynchronous replication does have some performance impact
      because commits are slower due to the need to wait for slaves.
      This is the tradeoff for increased data integrity. The amount of
      slowdown is at least the TCP/IP roundtrip time to send the commit
      to the slave and wait for the acknowledgment of receipt by the
      slave. This means that semisynchronous replication works best for
      close servers communicating over fast networks, and worst for
      distant servers communicating over slow networks.

        Semisynchronous replication is implemented using plugins, so the
        plugins must be installed into the server to make them
        available. After a plugin has been installed, you control it by
        means of the system variables associated with it. These system
        variables are unavailable until the associated plugin has been
        installed.
      </p><p>
        To use semisynchronous replication, the following requirements
        must be satisfied:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            MySQL 5.5 or higher must be installed.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The capability of installing plugins requires a MySQL server
            that supports dynamic loading. To verify this, check that
            the value of the
            <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_have_dynamic_loading"><code class="literal">have_dynamic_loading</code></a> system
            variable is <code class="literal">YES</code>. Binary distributions
            should support dynamic loading.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Replication must already be working. For information on
            creating a master/slave relationship, see
            <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-howto" title="16.1.1. How to Set Up Replication">Section 16.1.1, “How to Set Up Replication”</a>.
</p></li></ul>
</div>
<p>
        To set up semisynchronous replication, use the following
        instructions. The <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#install-plugin" title="13.7.3.3. INSTALL PLUGIN Syntax"><code class="literal">INSTALL PLUGIN</code></a>,
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#set-statement" title="13.7.4. SET Syntax"><code class="literal">SET
        GLOBAL</code></a>, <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#stop-slave" title="13.4.2.6. STOP SLAVE Syntax"><code class="literal">STOP SLAVE</code></a>, and
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#start-slave" title="13.4.2.5. START SLAVE Syntax"><code class="literal">START SLAVE</code></a> statements mentioned
        here require the <a class="link" href="security.html#priv_super"><code class="literal">SUPER</code></a> privilege.
      </p><p>
        The semisynchronous replication plugins are included with MySQL
        distributions.
      </p><p>
        Unpack the component distribution, which contains files for the
        master side and the slave side.
      </p><p>
        Install the component files in the plugin directory of the
        appropriate server. Install the
        <code class="filename">semisync_master*</code> files in the plugin
        directory of the master server. Install the
        <code class="filename">semisync_slave*</code> files in the plugin
        directory of each slave server. The location of the plugin
        directory is available as the value of the server's
        <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_plugin_dir"><code class="literal">plugin_dir</code></a> system variable.
      </p><p>
        To load the plugins, use the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#install-plugin" title="13.7.3.3. INSTALL PLUGIN Syntax"><code class="literal">INSTALL
        PLUGIN</code></a> statement on the master and on each slave that
        is to be semisynchronous.
      </p><p>
        On the master:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>INSTALL PLUGIN rpl_semi_sync_master SONAME 'semisync_master.so';</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        On each slave:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>INSTALL PLUGIN rpl_semi_sync_slave SONAME 'semisync_slave.so';</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        The preceding commands use a plugin file name suffix of
        <code class="filename">.so</code>. A different suffix might apply on your
        system. If you are not sure about the plugin file name, look for
        the plugins in the server's plugin directory.
      </p><p>
        If an attempt to install a plugin results in an error on Linux
        similar to that shown here, you will need to install
        <code class="literal">libimf</code>:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>INSTALL PLUGIN rpl_semi_sync_master SONAME 'semisync_master.so';</code></strong>
ERROR 1126 (HY000): Can't open shared library
'/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin/semisync_master.so' (errno: 22 libimf.so: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory)
</pre><p>
        You can obtain <code class="literal">libimf</code> from
        <a class="ulink" href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/os-linux.html" target="_top">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/os-linux.html</a>.
      </p><p>
        To see which plugins are installed, use the
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#show-plugins" title="13.7.5.26. SHOW PLUGINS Syntax"><code class="literal">SHOW PLUGINS</code></a> statement, or query
        the <a class="link" href="information-schema.html#plugins-table" title="20.15. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PLUGINS Table"><code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS</code></a>
        table.
      </p><p>
        After a semisynchronous replication plugin has been installed,
        it is disabled by default. The plugins must be enabled both on
        the master side and the slave side to enable semisynchronous
        replication. If only one side is enabled, replication will be
        asynchronous.
      </p><p>
        To control whether an installed plugin is enabled, set the
        appropriate system variables. You can set these variables at
        runtime using <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#set-statement" title="13.7.4. SET Syntax"><code class="literal">SET
        GLOBAL</code></a>, or at server startup on the command line or in
        an option file.
      </p><p>
        At runtime, these master-side system variables are available:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SET GLOBAL rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled = {0|1};</code></strong>
mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SET GLOBAL rpl_semi_sync_master_timeout = <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em>;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        On the slave side, this system variable is available:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SET GLOBAL rpl_semi_sync_slave_enabled = {0|1};</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        For
        <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled"><code class="literal">rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled</code></a> or
        <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_slave_enabled"><code class="literal">rpl_semi_sync_slave_enabled</code></a>,
        the value should be 1 to enable semisynchronous replication or 0
        to disable it. By default, these variables are set to 1.
      </p><p>
        For
        <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_master_timeout"><code class="literal">rpl_semi_sync_master_timeout</code></a>,
        the value <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> is given in milliseconds.
        The default value is 10000 (10 seconds).
      </p><p>
        If you enable semisynchronous replication on a slave at runtime,
        you must also start the slave I/O thread (stopping it first if
        it is already running) to cause the slave to connect to the
        master and register as a semisynchronous slave:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>STOP SLAVE IO_THREAD; START SLAVE IO_THREAD;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        If the I/O thread is already running and you do not restart it,
        the slave continues to use asynchronous replication.
      </p><p>
        At server startup, the variables that control semisynchronous
        replication can be set as command-line options or in an option
        file. A setting listed in an option file takes effect each time
        the server starts. For example, you can set the variables in
        <code class="filename">my.cnf</code> files on the master and slave sides
        as follows.
      </p><p>
        On the master:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">[mysqld]
rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled=1
rpl_semi_sync_master_timeout=1000 # 1 second</pre><p>
        On each slave:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">[mysqld]
rpl_semi_sync_slave_enabled=1</pre>

<a class="indexterm" name="idp104565056"></a><p>
        The plugins for the semisynchronous replication capability
        expose several system and status variables that you can examine
        to determine its configuration and operational state.
      </p><p>
        The system variable reflect how semisynchronous replication is
        configured. To check their values, use <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#show-variables" title="13.7.5.40. SHOW VARIABLES Syntax"><code class="literal">SHOW
        VARIABLES</code></a>:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'rpl_semi_sync%';</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        The status variables enable you to monitor the operation of
        semisynchronous replication. To check their values, use
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#show-status" title="13.7.5.36. SHOW STATUS Syntax"><code class="literal">SHOW STATUS</code></a>:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Rpl_semi_sync%';</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        When the master switches between asynchronous or semisynchronous
        replication due to commit-blocking timeout or a slave catching
        up, it sets the value of the
        <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#statvar_Rpl_semi_sync_master_status"><code class="literal">Rpl_semi_sync_master_status</code></a>
        status variable appropriately. Automatic fallback from
        semisynchronous to asynchronous replication on the master means
        that it is possible for the
        <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled"><code class="literal">rpl_semi_sync_master_enabled</code></a>
        system variable to have a value of 1 on the master side even
        when semisynchronous replication is in fact not operational at
        the moment. You can monitor the
        <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#statvar_Rpl_semi_sync_master_status"><code class="literal">Rpl_semi_sync_master_status</code></a>
        status variable to determine whether the master currently is
        using asynchronous or semisynchronous replication.
      </p><p>
        To see how many semisynchronous slaves are connected, check
        <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#statvar_Rpl_semi_sync_master_clients"><code class="literal">Rpl_semi_sync_master_clients</code></a>.
      </p><p>

      MySQL 5.6 supports delayed replication such that a
      slave server deliberately lags behind the master by at least a
      specified amount of time. The default delay is 0 seconds. Use the
      <code class="literal">MASTER_DELAY</code> option for
      <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#change-master-to" title="13.4.2.1. CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"><code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER TO</code></a> to set the delay
      to <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> seconds:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_DELAY = <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em>;
</pre><p>
      An event received from the master is not executed until at least
      <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> seconds later than its execution on
      the master. The exceptions are that there is no delay for format
      description events or log file rotation events, which affect only
      the internal state of the SQL thread.
    </p><p>
      Delayed replication can be used for several purposes:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          To protect against user mistakes on the master. A DBA can roll
          back a delayed slave to the time just before the disaster.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          To test how the system behaves when there is a lag. For
          example, in an application, a lag might be caused by a heavy
          load on the slave. However, it can be difficult to generate
          this load level. Delayed replication can simulate the lag
          without having to simulate the load. It can also be used to
          debug conditions related to a lagging slave.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          To inspect what the database looked like long ago, without
          having to reload a backup. For example, if the delay is one
          week and the DBA needs to see what the database looked like
          before the last few days' worth of development, the delayed
          slave can be inspected.

        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

      The following sections provide information about what is supported
      and what is not in MySQL replication, and about specific issues
      and situations that may occur when replicating certain statements.
    </p><p>
      Statement-based replication depends on compatibility at the SQL
      level between the master and slave. In others, successful SBR
      requires that any SQL features used be supported by both the
      master and the slave servers. For example, if you use a feature on
      the master server that is available only in MySQL 5.6
      (or later), you cannot replicate to a slave that uses MySQL
      5.5 (or earlier).
    </p><p>
      Such incompatibilities also can occur within a release series when
      using pre-production releases of MySQL. For example, the
      <a class="link" href="functions.html#function_sleep"><code class="literal">SLEEP()</code></a> function is available
      beginning with MySQL 5.0.12. If you use this function on the
      master, you cannot replicate to a slave that uses MySQL 5.0.11 or
      earlier.
    </p><p>
      For this reason, use Generally Available (GA) releases of MySQL
      for statement-based replication in a production setting, since we
      do not introduce new SQL statements or change their behavior
      within a given release series once that series reaches GA release
      status.
    </p><p>
      If you are planning to use statement-based replication between
      MySQL 5.6 and a previous MySQL release series, it is
      also a good idea to consult the edition of the <em class="citetitle">MySQL
      Reference Manual</em> corresponding to the earlier release
      series for information regarding the replication characteristics
      of that series.
    </p><p>
      With MySQL's statement-based replication, there may be issues with
      replicating stored routines or triggers. You can avoid these
      issues by using MySQL's row-based replication instead. For a
      detailed list of issues, see
      <a class="xref" href="stored-programs-views.html#stored-programs-logging" title="19.7. Binary Logging of Stored Programs">Section 19.7, “Binary Logging of Stored Programs”</a>. For more information
      about row-based logging and row-based replication, see

            Adding an <code class="literal">AUTO_INCREMENT</code> column to a
            table with <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#alter-table" title="13.1.7. ALTER TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">ALTER TABLE</code></a> might
            not produce the same ordering of the rows on the slave and
            the master. This occurs because the order in which the rows
            are numbered depends on the specific storage engine used for
            the table and the order in which the rows were inserted. If
            it is important to have the same order on the master and

            <code class="literal">col1</code> and <code class="literal">col2</code>, the

<p xmlns="">
              To guarantee the same ordering on both master and slave,

        accepts data but discards it and does not store it. When
        performing binary logging, all inserts to such tables are always
        logged, regardless of the logging format in use. Updates and
        deletes are handled differently depending on whether statement
        based or row based logging is in use. With the statement based
        logging format, all statements affecting
        <code class="literal">BLACKHOLE</code> tables are logged, but their
        effects ignored. When using row-based logging, updates and
        deletes to such tables are simply skipped—they are not
        written to the binary log. In MySQL 5.6.12 and later, a warning
        is logged whenever this occurs (Bug #13004581)

        The following applies to replication between MySQL servers that
        use different character sets:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            If the master uses MySQL 4.1, you must
            <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> use the same
            <span class="emphasis"><em>global</em></span> character set and collation on
            the master and the slave, regardless of the slave MySQL
            version. (These are controlled by the
            <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#option_mysqld_character-set-server"><code class="option">--character-set-server</code></a> and
            <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#option_mysqld_collation-server"><code class="option">--collation-server</code></a> options.)
            Otherwise, you may get duplicate-key errors on the slave,
            because a key that is unique in the master character set
            might not be unique in the slave character set. Note that
            this is not a cause for concern when master and slave are
            both MySQL 5.0 or later.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            If the master is older than MySQL 4.1.3, the character set
            of any client should never be made different from its global
            value because this character set change is not known to the
            slave. In other words, clients should not use <code class="literal">SET
            NAMES</code>, <code class="literal">SET CHARACTER SET</code>, and
            so forth. If both the master and the slave are 4.1.3 or
            newer, clients can freely set session values for character
            set variables because these settings are written to the
            binary log and so are known to the slave. That is, clients
            can use <code class="literal">SET NAMES</code> or <code class="literal">SET
            CHARACTER SET</code> or can set variables such as
            <code class="literal">collation_client</code> or
            <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_collation_server"><code class="literal">collation_server</code></a>. However,
            clients are prevented from changing the
            <span class="emphasis"><em>global</em></span> value of these variables; as
            stated previously, the master and slave must always have
            identical global character set values. This is true whether
            you are using statement-based or row-based replication.

        This section discusses how MySQL replicates
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-table-select" title="13.1.17.1. CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE
        TABLE ... SELECT</code></a> statements.
      </p><p>
        MySQL 5.6 does not allow a
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-table-select" title="13.1.17.1. CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE
        TABLE ... SELECT</code></a> statement to make any changes in
        tables other than the table that is created by the statement.
        This is a change in behavior from previous versions of MySQL,
        which permitted these statements to do so. This means that, when
        using statement-based replication between a MySQL 5.6 or later
        slave and a master running a previous version of MySQL, a
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-table-select" title="13.1.17.1. CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE
        TABLE ... SELECT</code></a> statement causing changes in other
        tables on the master fails on the slave, causing replication to
        stop. To keep this from happening, you should use row-based
        replication, rewrite the offending statement before running it
        on the master, or upgrade the master to MySQL 5.6 (or later).
        (If you choose to upgrade the master, keep in mind that such a
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-table-select" title="13.1.17.1. CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE
        TABLE ... SELECT</code></a> statement will fail following the
        upgrade unless it is rewritten to remove any side effects on
        other tables.) This is not an issue when using row-based
        replication, because the statement is logged as a
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-table" title="13.1.17. CREATE TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE TABLE</code></a> statement with any
        changes to table data logged as row-insert events, rather than

              factors, including its type, whether it is defined with a
              <code class="literal">DEFAULT</code> option, whether it is declared
              as <code class="literal">NULL</code>, and the server SQL mode in

          In addition, when the slave's copy of the table has more
          columns than the master's copy, each column common to the
          tables must use the same data type in both tables.
        </p><p><b>Examples. </b>
            The following examples illustrate some valid and invalid
            table definitions:

            The following table definitions are valid and replicate
            correctly:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">master&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 INT);</code></strong>
slave&gt;  <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);</code></strong>
</pre><p>
          The following table definitions would raise Error 1532
          (<a class="link" href="error-handling.html#error_er_binlog_row_rbr_to_sbr"><code class="literal">ER_BINLOG_ROW_RBR_TO_SBR</code></a>)
          because the definitions of the columns common to both versions
          of the table are in a different order on the slave than they
          are on the master:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">master&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 INT);</code></strong>
slave&gt;  <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c2 INT, c1 INT);</code></strong>
</pre><p>
          The following table definitions would also raise Error 1532
          because the definition of the extra column on the master
          appears before the definitions of the columns common to both
          versions of the table:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">master&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c3 INT, c1 INT, c2 INT);</code></strong>
slave&gt;  <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);</code></strong>
</pre><p><b>More columns on the slave. </b>
            The following table definitions are valid and replicate

          </p><pre class="programlisting">master&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);</code></strong>
slave&gt;  <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 INT);</code></strong>
                  </pre><p>
          The following definitions raise Error 1532 because the columns
          common to both versions of the table are not defined in the
          same order on both the master and the slave:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">master&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);</code></strong>
slave&gt;  <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c2 INT, c1 INT, c3 INT);</code></strong>
</pre><p>
          The following table definitions also raise Error 1532 because
          the definition for the extra column in the slave's version of
          the table appears before the definitions for the columns which
          are common to both versions of the table:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">master&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);</code></strong>
slave&gt;  <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c3 INT, c1 INT, c2 INT);</code></strong>
</pre><p>
          The following table definitions fail because the slave's
          version of the table has additional columns compared to the
          master's version, and the two versions of the table use
          different data types for the common column
          <code class="literal">c2</code>:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">master&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 BIGINT);</code></strong>

          Corresponding columns on the master's and the
          slave's copies of the same table ideally should have the
          same data type. However, beginning with MySQL 5.1.21, this is
          not always strictly enforced, as long as certain conditions
          are met.
        </p><p>
          All other things being equal, it is always possible to
          replicate from a column of a given data type to another column
          of the same type and same size or width, where applicable, or
          larger. For example, you can replicate from a
          <code class="literal">CHAR(10)</code> column to another
          <code class="literal">CHAR(10)</code>, or from a
          <code class="literal">CHAR(10)</code> column to a
          <code class="literal">CHAR(25)</code> column without any problems. In
          certain cases, it also possible to replicate from a column
          having one data type (on the master) to a column having a
          different data type (on the slave); when the data type of the
          master's version of the column is promoted to a type that
          is the same size or larger on the slave, this is known as
          <em class="firstterm">attribute promotion</em>.
        </p><p>
          Attribute promotion can be used with both statement-based and
          row-based replication, and is not dependent on the storage
          engine used by either the master or the slave. However, the
          choice of logging format does have an effect on the type
          conversions that are permitted; the particulars are discussed
          later in this section.

</div>
<p xmlns="">
            Whether you use statement-based or row-based replication,
            the slave's copy of the table cannot contain more
            columns than the master's copy if you wish to employ
            attribute promotion.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Statement-based replication. </b>
            When using statement-based replication, a simple rule of
            thumb to follow is, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">If the statement run on the
            master would also execute successfully on the slave, it
            should also replicate successfully</span>”</span>. In other words,
            if the statement uses a value that is compatible with the
            type of a given column on the slave, the statement can be
            replicated. For example, you can insert any value that fits
            in a <code class="literal">TINYINT</code> column into a
            <code class="literal">BIGINT</code> column as well; it follows that,
            even if you change the type of a <code class="literal">TINYINT</code>
            column in the slave's copy of a table to
            <code class="literal">BIGINT</code>, any insert into that column on
            the master that succeeds should also succeed on the slave,
            since it is impossible to have a legal
            <code class="literal">TINYINT</code> value that is large enough to
            exceed a <code class="literal">BIGINT</code> column.
          </p><p>
          Prior to MySQL 5.6.10, when using statement-based replication,
          <code class="literal">AUTO_INCREMENT</code> columns were required to be
          the same on both the master and the slave; otherwise, updates
          could be applied to the wrong table on the slave. (Bug
          #12669186)
        </p><p><a name="replication-features-attribute-promotion"></a><b>Row-based replication: attribute promotion and demotion. </b>
            Row-based replication in MySQL 5.6 supports
            attribute promotion and demotion between smaller data types
            and larger types. It is also possible to specify whether or
            not to permit lossy (truncated) or non-lossy conversions of
            demoted column values, as explained later in this section.
          </p><p><b>Lossy and non-lossy conversions. </b>
            In the event that the target type cannot represent the value
            being inserted, a decision must be made on how to handle the
            conversion. If we permit the conversion but truncate (or
            otherwise modify) the source value to achieve a
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fit</span>”</span> in the target column, we make what is
            known as a <em class="firstterm">lossy conversion</em>. A
            conversion which does not require truncation or similar
            modifications to fit the source column value in the target
            column is a <em class="firstterm">non-lossy</em> conversion.
          </p><p><b>Type conversion modes (<code class="literal">slave_type_conversions</code>
            variable). </b>
            The setting of the <code class="literal">slave_type_conversions</code>
            global server variable controls the type conversion mode
            used on the slave. This variable takes a set of values from
            the following table, which shows the effects of each mode on
            the slave's type-conversion behavior:
</p>
<div class="informaltable">

                  <p>
                    This does not imply that non-lossy conversions are
                    permitted, merely that only cases requiring either
                    lossy conversions or no conversion at all are
                    permitted; for example, enabling
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> this mode permits an
                    <code class="literal">INT</code> column to be converted to

                    <code class="literal">INT</code> column (non-lossy).
                    Attempting the latter conversion in this case would
                    cause replication to stop with an error on the
                    slave.

<p>
          When an integer type is promoted, its signedness is not
          preserved. By default, the slave treats all such values as
          signed. Beginning with MySQL 5.6.13, you can control this
          behavior using <code class="literal">ALL_SIGNED</code>,
          <code class="literal">ALL_UNSIGNED</code>, or both. (Bug#15831300)
          <code class="literal">ALL_SIGNED</code> tells the slave to treat all
          promoted integer types as signed;
          <code class="literal">ALL_UNSIGNED</code> instructs it to treat these as
          unsigned. Specifying both causes the slave to treat the value
          as signed if possible, otherwise to treat it as unsigned; the
          order in which they are listed is not significant. Neither
          <code class="literal">ALL_SIGNED</code> nor
          <code class="literal">ALL_UNSIGNED</code> has any effect if at least one
          of <code class="literal">ALL_LOSSY</code> or
          <code class="literal">ALL_NONLOSSY</code> is not also used.
        </p><p>
          Changing the type conversion mode requires restarting the

            In all cases, the size or width of the column on the slave
            must be equal to or greater than that of the column on the
            master. For example, you could replicate from a
            <code class="literal">CHAR(10)</code> column on the master to a column
            that used <code class="literal">BINARY(10)</code> or
            <code class="literal">BINARY(25)</code> on the slave, but you could
            not replicate from a <code class="literal">CHAR(10)</code> column on
            the master to <code class="literal">BINARY(5)</code> column on the
            slave.

            Any unique index (including primary keys) having a prefix
            must use a prefix of the same length on both master and
            slave; in such cases, differing prefix lengths are
            disallowed. It is possible to use a nonunique index whose
            prefix length differs between master and slave, but this can
            cause serious performance issues, particularly when the
            prefix used on the master is longer. This is due to the fact
            that 2 unique prefixes of a given length may no longer be
            unique at a shorter length; for example, the words
            <span class="emphasis"><em>catalogue</em></span> and
            <span class="emphasis"><em>catamount</em></span> have the 5-character prefixes
            <span class="emphasis"><em>catal</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>catam</em></span>,
            respectively, but share the same 4-character prefix
            (<span class="emphasis"><em>cata</em></span>). This can lead to queries that
            use such indexes executing less efficiently on the slave,
            when a shorter prefix is employed in the slave'
            definition of the same index than on the master.

        To determine whether there are any scheduled events on a MySQL
        server that were created on a different server (that was acting
        as a replication master), query the
        <a class="link" href="information-schema.html#events-table" title="20.7. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table"><code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS</code></a> table in
        a manner similar to what is shown here:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">SELECT EVENT_SCHEMA, EVENT_NAME
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS
    WHERE STATUS = 'SLAVESIDE_DISABLED';</pre><p>
        Alternatively, you can use the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#show-events" title="13.7.5.19. SHOW EVENTS Syntax"><code class="literal">SHOW
        EVENTS</code></a> statement, like this:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">SHOW EVENTS
    WHERE STATUS = 'SLAVESIDE_DISABLED';</pre><p>
        When promoting a replication slave having such events to a
        replication master, you must enable each event using
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#alter-event" title="13.1.2. ALTER EVENT Syntax"><code class="literal">ALTER EVENT
        <em class="replaceable"><code>event_name</code></em> ENABLED</code></a>, where
        <em class="replaceable"><code>event_name</code></em> is the name of the event.
      </p><p>
        If more than one master was involved in creating events on this
        slave, and you wish to identify events that were created only on
        a given master having the server ID
        <em class="replaceable"><code>master_id</code></em>, modify the previous query
        on the <a class="link" href="information-schema.html#events-table" title="20.7. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table"><code class="literal">EVENTS</code></a> table to include the
        <code class="literal">ORIGINATOR</code> column, as shown here:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">SELECT EVENT_SCHEMA, EVENT_NAME, ORIGINATOR
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EVENTS
    WHERE STATUS = 'SLAVESIDE_DISABLED'
    AND   ORIGINATOR = '<em class="replaceable"><code>master_id</code></em>'
</pre><p>
        You can employ <code class="literal">ORIGINATOR</code> with the
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#show-events" title="13.7.5.19. SHOW EVENTS Syntax"><code class="literal">SHOW EVENTS</code></a> statement in a
        similar fashion:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">SHOW EVENTS
    WHERE STATUS = 'SLAVESIDE_DISABLED'
    AND   ORIGINATOR = '<em class="replaceable"><code>master_id</code></em>'
</pre><p>
        Before enabling events that were replicated from the master, you
        should disable the MySQL Event Scheduler on the slave (using a
        statement such as <code class="literal">SET GLOBAL event_scheduler =
        OFF;</code>), run any necessary <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#alter-event" title="13.1.2. ALTER EVENT Syntax"><code class="literal">ALTER
        EVENT</code></a> statements, restart the server, then re-enable
        the Event Scheduler on the slave afterward (using a statement
        such as <code class="literal">SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;</code>)-
      </p><p>
        If you later demote the new master back to being a replication
        slave, you must disable manually all events enabled by the
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#alter-event" title="13.1.2. ALTER EVENT Syntax"><code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code></a> statements. You can
        do this by storing in a separate table the event names from the
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#select" title="13.2.9. SELECT Syntax"><code class="literal">SELECT</code></a> statement shown
        previously, or using <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#alter-event" title="13.1.2. ALTER EVENT Syntax"><code class="literal">ALTER EVENT</code></a>
        statements to rename the events with a common prefix such as
        <code class="literal">replicated_</code> to identify them.
      </p><p>
        If you rename the events, then when demoting this server back to
        being a replication slave, you can identify the events by
        querying the <a class="link" href="information-schema.html#events-table" title="20.7. The INFORMATION_SCHEMA EVENTS Table"><code class="literal">EVENTS</code></a> table, as shown
        here:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">SELECT CONCAT(EVENT_SCHEMA, '.', EVENT_NAME) AS 'Db.Event'

        With statement-based replication, values are converted from
        decimal to binary. Because conversions between decimal and
        binary representations of them may be approximate, comparisons
        involving floating-point values are inexact. This is true for
        operations that use floating-point values explicitly, or that
        use values that are converted to floating-point implicitly.
        Comparisons of floating-point values might yield different
        results on master and slave servers due to differences in
        computer architecture, the compiler used to build MySQL, and so
        forth. See <a class="xref" href="functions.html#type-conversion" title="12.2. Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation">Section 12.2, “Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation”</a>, and

            Local time in Stockholm is 6 hours later than in New York;
            so, if you issue <code class="literal">SELECT NOW()</code> on the

            these functions should not be used to insert into a master

            Beginning with MySQL 5.5.1, these functions are

<p>
        As a workaround for the preceding limitations when
        statement-based replication is in effect, you can use the
        strategy of saving the problematic function result in a user
        variable and referring to the variable in a later statement. For
        example, the following single-row
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#insert" title="13.2.5. INSERT Syntax"><code class="literal">INSERT</code></a> is problematic due to the
        reference to the <a class="link" href="functions.html#function_uuid"><code class="literal">UUID()</code></a> function:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">INSERT INTO t VALUES(UUID());</pre><p>
        To work around the problem, do this instead:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">SET @my_uuid = UUID();
INSERT INTO t VALUES(@my_uuid);</pre><p>
        That sequence of statements replicates because the value of
        <code class="literal">@my_uuid</code> is stored in the binary log as a
        user-variable event prior to the
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#insert" title="13.2.5. INSERT Syntax"><code class="literal">INSERT</code></a> statement and is available
        for use in the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#insert" title="13.2.5. INSERT Syntax"><code class="literal">INSERT</code></a>.
      </p><p>
        The same idea applies to multiple-row inserts, but is more
        cumbersome to use. For a two-row insert, you can do this:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">SET @my_uuid1 = UUID(); @my_uuid2 = UUID();
INSERT INTO t VALUES(@my_uuid1),(@my_uuid2);</pre><p>
        However, if the number of rows is large or unknown, the
        workaround is difficult or impracticable. For example, you
        cannot convert the following statement to one in which a given
        individual user variable is associated with each row:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">INSERT INTO t2 SELECT UUID(), * FROM t1;</pre><p>
        Within a stored function, <a class="link" href="functions.html#function_rand"><code class="literal">RAND()</code></a>
        replicates correctly as long as it is invoked only once during
        the execution of the function. (You can consider the function
        execution timestamp and random number seed as implicit inputs
        that are identical on the master and slave.)
      </p><p>
        The <a class="link" href="functions.html#function_found-rows"><code class="literal">FOUND_ROWS()</code></a> and
        <a class="link" href="functions.html#function_row-count"><code class="literal">ROW_COUNT()</code></a> functions are not
        replicated reliably using statement-based replication. A
        workaround is to store the result of the function call in a user
        variable, and then use that in the
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#insert" title="13.2.5. INSERT Syntax"><code class="literal">INSERT</code></a> statement. For example, if
        you wish to store the result in a table named
        <code class="literal">mytable</code>, you might normally do so like this:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS FROM mytable LIMIT 1;
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES( FOUND_ROWS() );</pre><p>
        However, if you are replicating <code class="literal">mytable</code>, you
        should use <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#select-into" title="13.2.9.1. SELECT ... INTO Syntax"><code class="literal">SELECT
        ... INTO</code></a>, and then store the variable in the table,
        like this:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS INTO @found_rows FROM mytable LIMIT 1;
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES(@found_rows);</pre><p>
        In this way, the user variable is replicated as part of the
        context, and applied on the slave correctly.
      </p><p>
        These functions are automatically replicated using row-based
        replication when using <code class="literal">MIXED</code> mode, and
        generate a warning in <code class="literal">STATEMENT</code> mode. (Bug

        It is safe to shut down a master server and restart it later.
        When a slave loses its connection to the master, the slave tries
        to reconnect immediately and retries periodically if that fails.
        The default is to retry every 60 seconds. This may be changed
        with the <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#change-master-to" title="13.4.2.1. CHANGE MASTER TO Syntax"><code class="literal">CHANGE MASTER TO</code></a>
        statement. A slave also is able to deal with network
        connectivity outages. However, the slave notices the network
        outage only after receiving no data from the master for
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_slave_net_timeout"><code class="literal">slave_net_timeout</code></a> seconds. If
        your outages are short, you may want to decrease
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_slave_net_timeout"><code class="literal">slave_net_timeout</code></a>. See
        <a class="xref" href="server-administration.html#server-system-variables" title="5.1.4. Server System Variables">Section 5.1.4, “Server System Variables”</a>.
      </p><p>
        An unclean shutdown (for example, a crash) on the master side
        can result in the master binary log having a final position less
        than the most recent position read by the slave, due to the
        master binary log file not being flushed. This can cause the
        slave not to be able to replicate when the master comes back up.
        Setting <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_sync_binlog"><code class="literal">sync_binlog=1</code></a> in the
        master <code class="filename">my.cnf</code> file helps to minimize this
        problem because it causes the master to flush its binary log
        more frequently.
      </p><p>
        Shutting down a slave cleanly is safe because it keeps track of
        where it left off. However, be careful that the slave does not
        have temporary tables open; see
        <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-features-temptables" title="16.4.1.22. Replication and Temporary Tables">Section 16.4.1.22, “Replication and Temporary Tables”</a>. Unclean
        shutdowns might produce problems, especially if the disk cache
        was not flushed to disk before the problem occurred:

<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            For transactions, the slave commits and then updates
            <code class="filename">relay-log.info</code>. If a crash occurs
            between these two operations, relay log processing will have
            proceeded further than the information file indicates and
            the slave will re-execute the events from the last
            transaction in the relay log after it has been restarted.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            A similar problem can occur if the slave updates

            crashes before the write has been flushed to disk. To
            minimize the chance of this occurring, set
            <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_sync_relay_log_info"><code class="literal">sync_relay_log_info=1</code></a> in

            <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_sync_relay_log_info"><code class="literal">sync_relay_log_info</code></a> is 0,

        An alternative restart method may apply in some cases. When

        <a class="link" href="storage-engines.html#memory-storage-engine" title="14.4. The MEMORY Storage Engine"><code class="literal">MEMORY</code></a> tables will still be

      </p><p><b>Safe slave shutdown when using temporary tables. </b>
          Temporary tables are replicated except in the case where you
          stop the slave server (not just the slave threads) and you
          have replicated temporary tables that are open for use in
          updates that have not yet been executed on the slave. If you
          stop the slave server, the temporary tables needed by those
          updates are no longer available when the slave is restarted.
          To avoid this problem, do not shut down the slave while it has
          temporary tables open. Instead, use the following procedure:
</p>

<p><b>Temporary tables and replication options. </b>
          By default, all temporary tables are replicated; this happens

          options are honored for temporary tables.
        </p><p>
        A recommended practice when using statement-based or
        mixed-format replication is to designate a prefix for exclusive
        use in naming temporary tables that you do not want replicated,
        then employ a
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-wild-ignore-table"><code class="option">--replicate-wild-ignore-table</code></a>
        option to match that prefix. For example, you might give all
        such tables names beginning with <code class="literal">norep</code> (such
        as <code class="literal">norepmytable</code>,
        <code class="literal">norepyourtable</code>, and so on), then use

<a class="indexterm" name="idp105431424"></a><a class="indexterm" name="idp105432912"></a><p>
        You can encounter problems when you attempt to replicate from an
        older master to a newer slave and you make use of identifiers on
        the master that are reserved words in the newer MySQL version
        running on the slave. An example of this is using a table column
        named <code class="literal">current_user</code> on a 4.0 master that is
        replicating to a 4.1 or higher slave because
        <code class="literal">CURRENT_USER</code> is a reserved word beginning in
        MySQL 4.1. Replication can fail in such cases with Error 1064
        <span class="errortext">You have an error in your SQL syntax...</span>,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>even if a database or table named using the reserved
        word or a table having a column named using the reserved word is
        excluded from replication</em></span>. This is due to the fact
        that each SQL event must be parsed by the slave prior to
        execution, so that the slave knows which database object or
        objects would be affected; only after the event is parsed can
        the slave apply any filtering rules defined by
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-db"><code class="option">--replicate-do-db</code></a>,
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-do-table"><code class="option">--replicate-do-table</code></a>,
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_replicate-ignore-db"><code class="option">--replicate-ignore-db</code></a>, and

      </p><p>
        To work around the problem of database, table, or column names
        on the master which would be regarded as reserved words by the
        slave, do one of the following:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            Use one or more <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#alter-table" title="13.1.7. ALTER TABLE Syntax"><code class="literal">ALTER TABLE</code></a>
            statements on the master to change the names of any database
            objects where these names would be considered reserved words
            on the slave, and change any SQL statements that use the old
            names to use the new names instead.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            In any SQL statements using these database object names,
            write the names as quoted identifiers using backtick
            characters (<code class="literal">`</code>).

        If a statement produces the same error (identical error code) on
        both the master and the slave, the error is logged, but
        replication continues.
      </p><p>
        If a statement produces different errors on the master and the
        slave, the slave SQL thread terminates, and the slave writes a
        message to its error log and waits for the database
        administrator to decide what to do about the error. This
        includes the case that a statement produces an error on the
        master or the slave, but not both. To address the issue, connect
        to the slave manually and determine the cause of the problem.
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#show-slave-status" title="13.7.5.35. SHOW SLAVE STATUS Syntax"><code class="literal">SHOW SLAVE STATUS</code></a> is useful for
        this. Then fix the problem and run <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#start-slave" title="13.4.2.5. START SLAVE Syntax"><code class="literal">START
        SLAVE</code></a>. For example, you might need to create a
        nonexistent table before you can start the slave again.
      </p><p>
        If this error code validation behavior is not desirable, some or
        all errors can be masked out (ignored) with the
        <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_slave-skip-errors"><code class="option">--slave-skip-errors</code></a> option.
      </p><p>
        For nontransactional storage engines such as
        <code class="literal">MyISAM</code>, it is possible to have a statement
        that only partially updates a table and returns an error code.
        This can happen, for example, on a multiple-row insert that has
        one row violating a key constraint, or if a long update
        statement is killed after updating some of the rows. If that
        happens on the master, the slave expects execution of the
        statement to result in the same error code. If it does not, the
        slave SQL thread stops as described previously.
      </p><p>
        If you are replicating between tables that use different storage
        engines on the master and slave, keep in mind that the same
        statement might produce a different error when run against one
        version of the table, but not the other, or might cause an error
        for one version of the table, but not the other. For example,
        since <code class="literal">MyISAM</code> ignores foreign key constraints,
        an <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#insert" title="13.2.5. INSERT Syntax"><code class="literal">INSERT</code></a> or
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#update" title="13.2.11. UPDATE Syntax"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></a> statement accessing an
        <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> table on the master might cause a
        foreign key violation but the same statement performed on a
        <code class="literal">MyISAM</code> version of the same table on the slave
        would produce no such error, causing replication to stop.

        statements to be handled differently on the master and the

        using statement-based or row-based replication.
      </p><p>
        If you are replicating partitioned tables, using different SQL
        modes on the master and the slave is likely to cause issues. At
        a minimum, this is likely to cause the distribution of data
        among partitions to be different in the master's and slave's
        copies of a given table. It may also cause inserts into
        partitioned tables that succeed on the master to fail on the

          To apply those rules, the server considers a statement
          nontransactional if it changes only nontransactional tables,
          and transactional if it changes only transactional tables. In
          MySQL 5.6, a statement that references both
          nontransactional and transactional tables and updates
          <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> of the tables involved, is considered
          a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mixed</span>”</span> statement. (In previous MySQL release
          series, a statement that changed both nontransactional and
          transactional tables was considered mixed.) Mixed statements,
          like transactional statements, are cached and logged when the
          transaction commits.

        In situations where transactions mix updates to transactional
        and nontransactional tables, the order of statements in the
        binary log is correct, and all needed statements are written to
        the binary log even in case of a
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#commit" title="13.3.1. START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Syntax"><code class="literal">ROLLBACK</code></a>.
        However, when a second connection updates the nontransactional
        table before the first connection transaction is complete,
        statements can be logged out of order because the second
        connection update is written immediately after it is performed,
        regardless of the state of the transaction being performed by
        the first connection.
      </p><p><b>Using different storage engines on master and slave. </b>
          It is possible to replicate transactional tables on the master
          using nontransactional tables on the slave. For example, you
          can replicate an <code class="literal">InnoDB</code> master table as a
          <code class="literal">MyISAM</code> slave table. However, if you do
          this, there are problems if the slave is stopped in the middle
          of a <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#commit" title="13.3.1. START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Syntax"><code class="literal">BEGIN</code></a>
          ... <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#commit" title="13.3.1. START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Syntax"><code class="literal">COMMIT</code></a> block because the
          slave restarts at the beginning of the
          <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#commit" title="13.3.1. START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Syntax"><code class="literal">BEGIN</code></a> block.
        </p><p>
        In MySQL 5.6, it is also safe to replicate
        transactions from <a class="link" href="storage-engines.html#myisam-storage-engine" title="14.3. The MyISAM Storage Engine"><code class="literal">MyISAM</code></a> tables on
        the master to transactional tables—such as tables that use
        the <a class="link" href="storage-engines.html#innodb-storage-engine" title="14.2. The InnoDB Storage Engine"><code class="literal">InnoDB</code></a> storage engine—on
        the slave. In such cases (beginning with MySQL 5.5.0), an
        <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_autocommit"><code class="literal">AUTOCOMMIT=1</code></a>
        statement issued on the master is replicated, thus enforcing
        <code class="literal">AUTOCOMMIT</code> mode on the slave.
      </p><p>
        When the storage engine type of the slave is nontransactional,
        transactions on the master that mix updates of transactional and
        nontransactional tables should be avoided because they can cause
        inconsistency of the data between the master transactional table
        and the slave nontransactional table. That is, such transactions
        can lead to master storage engine-specific behavior with the
        possible effect of replication going out of synchrony. MySQL
        does not issue a warning about this currently, so extra care
        should be taken when replicating transactional tables from the
        master to nontransactional tables on the slaves.
      </p><p><b>Changing the binary logging format within transactions. </b>
          Beginning with MySQL 5.5.3, the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format</code></a> system variable
          is read-only as long as a transaction is in progress. (Bug
          #47863)
        </p><p>
        Every transaction (including
        <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sysvar_autocommit"><code class="literal">autocommit</code></a> transactions) is
        recorded in the binary log as though it starts with a
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#commit" title="13.3.1. START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Syntax"><code class="literal">BEGIN</code></a>
        statement, and ends with either a
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#commit" title="13.3.1. START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Syntax"><code class="literal">COMMIT</code></a> or a
        <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#commit" title="13.3.1. START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Syntax"><code class="literal">ROLLBACK</code></a>
        statement. In MySQL 5.6, this true is even for
        statements affecting tables that use a nontransactional storage
        engine (such as <a class="link" href="storage-engines.html#myisam-storage-engine" title="14.3. The MyISAM Storage Engine"><code class="literal">MyISAM</code></a>).

        With statement-based replication, triggers executed on the
        master also execute on the slave. With row-based replication,
        triggers executed on the master do not execute on the slave.
        Instead, the row changes on the master resulting from trigger
        execution are replicated and applied on the slave.
      </p><p>
        This behavior is by design. If under row-based replication the
        slave applied the triggers as well as the row changes caused by
        them, the changes would in effect be applied twice on the slave,
        leading to different data on the master and the slave.
      </p><p>
        If you want triggers to execute on both the master and the
        slave—perhaps because you have different triggers on the
        master and slave—you must use statement-based replication.
        However, to enable slave-side triggers, it is not necessary to
        use statement-based replication exclusively. It is sufficient to
        switch to statement-based replication only for those statements
        where you want this effect, and to use row-based replication the
        rest of the time.

        Views are always replicated to slaves. Views are filtered by

        a table that would normally be filtered out by

</div>

</div>
<p>
      MySQL supports replication from one major version to the next
      higher major version. For example, you can replicate from a master
      running MySQL 4.1 to a slave running MySQL 5.0, from a master
      running MySQL 5.0 to a slave running MySQL 5.1, and so on.
    </p><p>
      However, one may encounter difficulties when replicating from an
      older master to a newer slave if the master uses statements or
      relies on behavior no longer supported in the version of MySQL
      used on the slave. For example, in MySQL 5.5,
      <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#create-table-select" title="13.1.17.1. CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Syntax"><code class="literal">CREATE TABLE
      ... SELECT</code></a> statements are permitted to change tables
      other than the one being created, but are no longer allowed to do
      so in MySQL 5.6 (see
      <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-features-create-select" title="16.4.1.5. Replication of CREATE TABLE ... SELECT Statements">Section 16.4.1.5, “Replication of
        <code class="literal">CREATE
        TABLE ... SELECT</code> Statements”</a>).
    </p><p>
      The use of more than 2 MySQL Server versions is not supported in
      replication setups involving multiple masters, regardless of the
      number of master or slave MySQL servers. This restriction applies
      not only to major versions, but to minor versions within the same
      major version as well. For example, if you are using a chained or
      circular replication setup, you cannot use MySQL
      5.6.1, MySQL 5.6.2, and MySQL
      5.6.4 concurrently, although you could use any 2 of
      these releases together.
    </p><p>
      In some cases, it is also possible to replicate between a master
      and a slave that is more than one major version newer than the
      master. However, there are known issues with trying to replicate
      from a master running MySQL 4.1 or earlier to a slave running
      MySQL 5.1 or later. To work around such problems, you can insert a
      MySQL server running an intermediate version between the two; for
      example, rather than replicating directly from a MySQL 4.1 master
      to a MySQL 5.1 slave, it is possible to replicate from a MySQL 4.1
      server to a MySQL 5.0 server, and then from the MySQL 5.0 server
      to a MySQL 5.1 server.

<p xmlns="">
        It is strongly recommended to use the most recent release
        available within a given MySQL major version because replication
        (and other) capabilities are continually being improved. It is
        also recommended to upgrade masters and slaves that use early
        releases of a major version of MySQL to GA (production) releases
        when the latter become available for that major version.
</p>
</div>
<p>
      Replication from newer masters to older slaves may be possible,
      but is generally not supported. This is due to a number of
      factors:
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><b>Binary log format changes. </b>
            The binary log format can change between major releases.
            While we attempt to maintain backward compatibility, this is
            not always possible. For example, the binary log format
            implemented in MySQL 5.0 changed considerably from that used
            in previous versions, especially with regard to handling of
            character sets,
            <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#load-data" title="13.2.6. LOAD DATA INFILE Syntax"><code class="literal">LOAD DATA
            INFILE</code></a>, and time zones. This means that
            replication from a MySQL 5.0 (or later) master to a MySQL
            4.1 (or earlier) slave is generally not supported.
          </p><p>
          This also has significant implications for upgrading
          replication servers; see
          <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-upgrade" title="16.4.3. Upgrading a Replication Setup">Section 16.4.3, “Upgrading a Replication Setup”</a>, for more information.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><b>Use of row-based replication. </b>
            Row-based replication was implemented in MySQL 5.1.5, so you
            cannot replicate using row-based replication from any MySQL
            5.6 or later master to a slave older than MySQL
            5.1.5.
          </p><p>
          For more information about row-based replication, see
          <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-formats" title="16.1.2. Replication Formats">Section 16.1.2, “Replication Formats”</a>.

            You cannot replicate from a newer master to an older slave
            using statement-based replication if the statements to be
            replicated use SQL features available on the master but not
            on the slave.
          </p><p>
          However, if both the master and the slave support row-based
          replication, and there are no data definition statements to be
          replicated that depend on SQL features found on the master but
          not on the slave, you can use row-based replication to
          replicate the effects of data modification statements even if
          the DDL run on the master is not supported on the slave.

<h3 class="title"><a name="replication-upgrade"></a>16.4.3. Upgrading a Replication Setup</h3>

</div>

</div>

</div>
<p>
      When you upgrade servers that participate in a replication setup,
      the procedure for upgrading depends on the current server versions
      and the version to which you are upgrading.
    </p><p>
      This section applies to upgrading replication from older versions
      of MySQL to MySQL 5.6. A 4.0 server should be 4.0.3
      or newer.
    </p><p>
      When you upgrade a master to 5.6 from an earlier
      MySQL release series, you should first ensure that all the slaves
      of this master are using the same 5.6.x release. If
      this is not the case, you should first upgrade the slaves. To
      upgrade each slave, shut it down, upgrade it to the appropriate
      5.6.x version, restart it, and restart replication.
      Relay logs created by the slave after the upgrade are in
      5.6 format.
    </p><p>
      Changes affecting operations in strict SQL mode may result in
      replication failure on an updated slave. For example, as of MySQL
      5.6.13, the server restricts insertion of a
      <code class="literal">DEFAULT</code> value of 0 for temporal data types in
      strict mode (<a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sqlmode_strict_trans_tables"><code class="literal">STRICT_TRANS_TABLES</code></a>
      or <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#sqlmode_strict_all_tables"><code class="literal">STRICT_ALL_TABLES</code></a>). A
      resulting incompatibility for replication if you use
      statement-based logging
      (<a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=STATEMENT</code></a>) is that
      if a slave is upgraded, a nonupgraded master will execute
      statements without error that may fail on the slave and
      replication will stop. To deal with this, stop all new statements
      on the master and wait until the slaves catch up. Then upgrade the
      slaves. Alternatively, if you cannot stop new statements,
      temporarily change to row-based logging on the master
      (<a class="link" href="replication.html#sysvar_binlog_format"><code class="literal">binlog_format=ROW</code></a>) and wait
      until all slaves have processed all binary logs produced up to the
      point of this change. Then upgrade the slaves.
    </p><p>
      After the slaves have been upgraded, shut down the master, upgrade
      it to the same 5.6.x release as the slaves, and
      restart it. If you had temporarily changed the master to row-based
      logging, change it back to statement-based logging. The
      5.6 master is able to read the old binary logs
      written prior to the upgrade and to send them to the
      5.6 slaves. The slaves recognize the old format and
      handle it properly. Binary logs created by the master subsequent
      to the upgrade are in 5.6 format. These too are
      recognized by the 5.6 slaves.
    </p><p>
      In other words, when upgrading to MySQL 5.6, the
      slaves must be MySQL 5.6 before you can upgrade the
      master to 5.6. Note that downgrading from
      5.6 to older versions does not work so simply: You
      must ensure that any 5.6 binary log or relay log has
      been fully processed, so that you can remove it before proceeding
      with the downgrade.
    </p><p>
      Downgrading a replication setup to a previous version cannot be
      done once you have switched from statement-based to row-based
      replication, and after the first row-based statement has been
      written to the binlog. See <a class="xref" href="replication.html#replication-formats" title="16.1.2. Replication Formats">Section 16.1.2, “Replication Formats”</a>.
    </p><p>
      Some upgrades may require that you drop and re-create database
      objects when you move from one MySQL series to the next. For
      example, collation changes might require that table indexes be
      rebuilt. Such operations, if necessary, will be detailed at
      <a class="xref" href="installing.html#upgrading-from-previous-series" title="2.11.1.1. Upgrading from MySQL 5.5 to 5.6">Section 2.11.1.1, “Upgrading from MySQL 5.5 to 5.6”</a>. It is safest to
      perform these operations separately on the slaves and the master,
      and to disable replication of these operations from the master to
      the slave. To achieve this, use the following procedure:
</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
          Stop all the slaves and upgrade them. Restart them with the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start"><code class="option">--skip-slave-start</code></a> option so
          that they do not connect to the master. Perform any table
          repair or rebuilding operations needed to re-create database
          objects, such as use of <code class="literal">REPAIR TABLE</code> or
          <code class="literal">ALTER TABLE</code>, or dumping and reloading
          tables or triggers.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Disable the binary log on the master. To do this without
          restarting the master, execute a <code class="literal">SET sql_log_bin =
          0</code> statement. Alternatively, stop the master and
          restart it without the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-bin"><code class="option">--log-bin</code></a> option. If you
          restart the master, you might also want to disallow client
          connections. For example, if all clients connect using TCP/IP,
          use the <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#option_mysqld_skip-networking"><code class="option">--skip-networking</code></a>
          option when you restart the master.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          With the binary log disabled, perform any table repair or
          rebuilding operations needed to re-create database objects.
          The binary log must be disabled during this step to prevent
          these operations from being logged and sent to the slaves
          later.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Re-enable the binary log on the master. If you set

          execute a <code class="literal">SET sql_log_bin = 1</code> statement. If

          with <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-bin"><code class="option">--log-bin</code></a>, and without
          <a class="link" href="server-administration.html#option_mysqld_skip-networking"><code class="option">--skip-networking</code></a> so that
          clients and slaves can connect.

      Replication with global transaction identifiers was introduced in
      MySQL 5.6.7. If you are upgrading an existing replication setup
      from a version of MySQL that does not support GTIDs to a version
      that does, you should not enable GTIDs on either the master or the
      slave before making sure that the setup meets all the requirements
      for GTID-based replication. See

          If the slave was running previously but has stopped, the

          If a statement that succeeded on the master refuses to run on
          the slave, try the following procedure if it is not feasible
          to do a full database resynchronization by deleting the
          slave's databases and copying a new snapshot from the master:
</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
              Determine whether the affected table on the slave is
              different from the master table. Try to understand how
              this happened. Then make the slave's table identical to
              the master's and run <a class="link" href="sql-syntax.html#start-slave" title="13.4.2.5. START SLAVE Syntax"><code class="literal">START
              SLAVE</code></a>.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              If the preceding step does not work or does not apply, try
              to understand whether it would be safe to make the update
              manually (if needed) and then ignore the next statement
              from the master.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              If you decide that the slave can skip the next statement
              from the master, issue the following statements:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>SET GLOBAL sql_slave_skip_counter = <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em>;</code></strong>
mysql&gt; <strong class="userinput"><code>START SLAVE;</code></strong>
</pre><p>
              The value of <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> should be 1 if
              the next statement from the master does not use
              <code class="literal">AUTO_INCREMENT</code> or
              <a class="link" href="functions.html#function_last-insert-id"><code class="literal">LAST_INSERT_ID()</code></a>.
              Otherwise, the value should be 2. The reason for using a
              value of 2 for statements that use
              <code class="literal">AUTO_INCREMENT</code> or
              <a class="link" href="functions.html#function_last-insert-id"><code class="literal">LAST_INSERT_ID()</code></a> is that
              they take two events in the binary log of the master.

              If you are sure that the slave started out perfectly
              synchronized with the master, and that no one has updated
              the tables involved outside of the slave thread, then
              presumably the discrepancy is the result of a bug. If you
              are running the most recent version of MySQL, please
              report the problem. If you are running an older version,
              try upgrading to the latest production release to
              determine whether the problem persists.

<p>
      When you have determined that there is no user error involved, and
      replication still either does not work at all or is unstable, it
      is time to send us a bug report. We need to obtain as much
      information as possible from you to be able to track down the bug.
      Please spend some time and effort in preparing a good bug report.
    </p><p>
      If you have a repeatable test case that demonstrates the bug,
      please enter it into our bugs database using the instructions
      given in <a class="xref" href="introduction.html#bug-reports" title="1.7. How to Report Bugs or Problems">Section 1.7, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”</a>. If you have a
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">phantom</span>”</span> problem (one that you cannot duplicate at
      will), use the following procedure:
</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
          Verify that no user error is involved. For example, if you
          update the slave outside of the slave thread, the data goes
          out of synchrony, and you can have unique key violations on
          updates. In this case, the slave thread stops and waits for
          you to clean up the tables manually to bring them into
          synchrony. <span class="emphasis"><em>This is not a replication problem. It is
          a problem of outside interference causing replication to
          fail.</em></span>
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Run the slave with the
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-slave-updates"><code class="option">--log-slave-updates</code></a> and
          <a class="link" href="replication.html#option_mysqld_log-bin"><code class="option">--log-bin</code></a> options. These
          options cause the slave to log the updates that it receives
          from the master into its own binary logs.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Save all evidence before resetting the replication state. If
          we have no information or only sketchy information, it becomes
          difficult or impossible for us to track down the problem. The
          evidence you should collect is:

          The following should be helpful to find the problem statement.
          <em class="replaceable"><code>log_file</code></em> and

<p>
      After you have collected the evidence for the problem, try to
      isolate it as a separate test case first. Then enter the problem
      with as much information as possible into our bugs database using
      the instructions at <a class="xref" href="introduction.html#bug-reports" title="1.7. How to Report Bugs or Problems">Section 1.7, “How to Report Bugs or Problems”</a>.
