It can only be attached to <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> elements. Forms can be submitted either by clicking an explicit <code>&lt;input type=\"submit\"&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input type=\"image\"&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;</code>, or by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> when certain form elements have focus.</p>\n    <div class=\"warning\">\n      <p>Depending on the browser, the Enter key may only cause a form submission if the form has exactly one text field, or only when there is a submit button present. The interface should not rely on a particular behavior for this key unless the issue is forced by observing the keypress event for presses of the Enter key.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>\n    <pre><code>&lt;form id=\"target\" action=\"destination.html\"&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"text\" value=\"Hello there\" /&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Go\" /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"other\"&gt;\n  Trigger the handler\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n    <p>The event handler can be bound to the form:</p>\n    <pre><code>$('#target').submit(function() {\n  alert('Handler for .submit() called.');\n  return false;\n});</code></pre>\n    <p>Now when the form is submitted, the message is alerted. This happens prior to the actual submission, so we can cancel the submit action by calling <code>.preventDefault()</code> on the event object or by returning <code>false</code> from our handler. We can trigger the event manually when another element is clicked:</p>\n    <pre><code>$('#other').click(function() {\n  $('#target').submit();\n});</code></pre>\n    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also display the message. In addition, the default <code>submit</code> action on the form will be fired, so the form will be submitted.</p>\n    <p>The JavaScript <code>submit</code> event does not bubble in Internet Explorer. However, scripts that rely on event delegation with the <code>submit</code> event will work consistently across browsers as of jQuery 1.4, which has normalized the event's behavior. </p>\n  "}]}
