 <h2 class="title">Basic memory management</h2>
 
 <p class="para">
  The engine&#039;s memory management is implemented with features important to a system like PHP. The exact functionality of the engine&#039;s memory management and the optmizations performed are out of the scope of this document. However, a good understanding of its functionality provides a basis for a good understanding of the rest of the <code class="code">Hacker&#039;s Guide</code>, and introduce you to terminology and functionality used throughout PHP.
 </p>
 
 <p class="para">
  The most important of its features for the <code class="code">Hacker</code>, and the first thing to mention is tracking allocations. Tracking allocations allow the memory manager to avoid leaks, a thorn in the side of most <code class="code">Hackers</code>. When PHP is built in debug mode (<code class="code">--enable-debug</code>), detected leaks are reported, in a perfect world they would never get to deployment.
 </p>
 
 <p class="para">While tracking allocations is an important, and highly useful feature, the <code class="code">Hacker</code> should not become lazy! Always attempt to resolve leaks before deploying your code, a memory leak in a SAPI environment can become a very big problem, very quickly.</p>
 
 <p class="para">Another, perhaps more incidental but still noteworthy, feature is that the memory manager is the part that allows a hard limit on memory usage for each instance of PHP. As we all know, there is no such thing as unlimited. If some code is running out of memory, it is likely to be written wrong, either by the <code class="code">Hacker</code>, or the programmer of PHP. Limiting the memory therefore is not a restriction on the language that is supposed to be experienced in production, it is simply a way from stopping development environments from spiraling out of control when mistakes are made, and equally, when bugs are found in production.</p>
 
 <p class="para">From the <code class="code">Hacker&#039;s</code> perspective, the memory management API looks very much like libc&#039;s (or whoever the <code class="code">Hacker</code> prefers !) malloc implementation.</p>

   The engines memory management functions do not return <code class="code">NULL</code> upon failure, if memory cannot be allocated at runtime, the engine bails and raises an error.

 <div class="caution"><strong class="caution">Caution</strong>
  <p class="simpara">
   Always use valgrind before deploying code and as a normal part of the <code class="code">Hacker&#039;s</code> process. The engine can only report and detect leaks where it has allocated the memory. All of PHP is only a thin wrapper around third parties, those third parties do not use the engines memory management. Additionally, valgrind will catch errors that do not always halt or even have an apparent effect at execution time, it is just as important that there should be no errors, as it is important that avoidable leaks should be avoided.
